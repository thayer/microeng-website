<h1> L-Edit for the PC</h1><p>
<hr>
We have the following floating licenses at Thayer:
<pre>
Quantity	Version
4		L-Edit
1		L-Edit/Verify (includes DRC, Extract)
1		L-Edit/Pro (includes DRC, Extract, StdPlace/Route, Layout vs Schematic, ...)
</pre>

So, for example, we can run up to 6 copies of L-Edit at once, and up
to two of those can be running a DRC at once.
<p>
L-Edit/Pro and LVS are installed on the computers in room 222 Cummings.
<hr>
We also have a limited student version which we purchased with five 
copies of a textbook on VLSI design using L-Edit.
The book is "Physical Design of CMOS Integrated Circuits
using L-Edit" by John P. Uyemura; This version has limited memory, 
and has CIF and GDS II stream output disabled.  You can get CIF 
or GDS output by saving your file as a .tdb file, reading it into 
the full version of L-Edit (mac or pc) and re-writing as CIF or GDS.
