-------- Guidelines for AFS/NORTHSTAR/Nimbus Accounts ----------------------

Students, faculty, and staff of the college may obtain
AFS/Northstar/Nimbus accounts for any non-commercial, college-related
purpose.  A necessary and sufficient condition for such an account is
that the person is currently listed in the Dartmouth Name Directory
(DND).  Users may obtain accounts on NORTHSTAR by logging on as
"newuser" on Nimbus or any NORTHSTAR machine and completing the
application.  If the person terminates his or her formal association
with the college, NORTHSTAR Operations will close the account.

Under special circumstances, NORTHSTAR Operations may grant accounts on
NORTHSTAR to people not currently listed in the DND.  Like all NORTHSTAR
accounts, these non-Dartmouth accounts must be for non-commercial,
college-related business.  Each non-Dartmouth account must have a sponsor
who is a Dartmouth faculty or staff member and is currently listed in the DND.
The sponsor accepts all responsibility for the account.  A sponsor may obtain
a non-Dartmouth account on NORTHSTAR by logging on as "newuser" and
completing the online application, and then following up with an e-mail
message to "admin@northstar.Dartmouth.EDU" to verify sponsorship.  If the
sponsor terminates his or her formal association with the college, NORTHSTAR
Operations will close the account.

NORTHSTAR Operations may close any account that has not been logged into for
one year.

In the future, NORTHSTAR may find it necessary to charge for research use of
its facilities.  Notification will be made prior to such a charge being 
implemented.

The Dartmouth Computing Code governs all accounts.  NORTHSTAR Operations
reserves the right to disable or close any account whose use is found to
violate the Code or to pose an immediate threat to system operation.

These guidelines are subject to periodic review by NORTHSTAR Operations.
