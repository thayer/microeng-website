Below is a copy of instructions Prof. Geoff Nunes wrote for accessing our UNIX L-Edit from a PC using X-Win32(
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~mesospm/manual/protocols/ledit.html">
link</a>
 to his document):
</h1> 
<h2>
Using the Unix version of L-Edit.</h2>
The following are instructions for using the Unix version of L-Edit.&nbsp;
They are not actually instructions on L-Edit itself.&nbsp; For that, borrow
a manual from Nunes.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Initial Set Up&nbsp; (one time only stuff)</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Sit at one of our PC's with X-Win32 installed.&nbsp; The latest version
is 4.1.2.</li>

<li>
telnet to the Northstar machine germain</li>

<li>
edit (emacs is good) your .cshrc.local file (or create one) to have the
following two lines:</li>

<ul><tt>alias egeus&nbsp; 'exec xterm -geom 80x24+0+0 -ls -display egeus:0'</tt>
<br><tt>alias ledit '/usr/tanner/bin.hp700/ledit &amp;'</tt></ul>
NOTE:&nbsp; you can add additional lines for other machines you might be
sitting at.
<li>
Copy the file ledit.tdb from my account to yours.&nbsp; If you plan to
do all your mask work in a directory called mymasks, the command (assuming
mymasks exists) is</li>

<ul><tt>cp ~gnunes/public/ledit.tdb ~/mymasks</tt></ul>
</ul>

<h3>
Every time</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Launch X-Util32</li>

<li>
Click on the Colors menu and verify that "PseudoColor support in TrueColor
mode" is selected.</li>

<li>
Launch X-Win32</li>

<li>
Use your favorite telnet application to login to germain.&nbsp; cd to your
chosen working directory.</li>

<li>
Type egeus (or whatever).&nbsp; In a few moments, an xterm window should
appear on your desktop.</li>

<li>
In the xterm window, type ledit.&nbsp; An L-Edit window should appear.</li>

<li>
You might want to read the X-Win32 help file about 3-button mouse support/emulation,
since you need a 3-button mouse to use this version of L-Edit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Problems</h3>

<ul>
<li>
If an L-Edit window fails to appear, and after a minute or so you get a
message like</li>

<br><tt>>LicenseServ: Cannot talk to the LicenseServ server on host >>localhost&lt;&lt;</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Server not running??</tt>
<br>then send a <b><i>polite</i></b> e-mail to Mike Fromberger asking him
to re-start it.
<li>
If you get a message that looks like</li>

<br><tt>germain >Can't get 16 colors in 4 planes, using B/W</tt>
<br><tt>X Error of failed request:&nbsp; BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Major opcode of failed request:&nbsp; 62 (X_CopyArea)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Serial number of failed request:&nbsp; 529</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp; Current serial number in output stream:&nbsp; 556</tt>
<br>then you don't have "PseudoColor support in TrueColor mode" selected.&nbsp;
See the instructions above.</ul>
