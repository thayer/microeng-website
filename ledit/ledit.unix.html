<h2> Configuring and running L-Edit on Northstar</h2>
<p>
Put these definitions in your .cshrc.local file on northstar:
<pre>
alias germain  'xhost +germain >/dev/null; exec xterm -geom 80x24+0+0 -e telnet germain &'
alias ledit '/usr/tanner/bin.hp700/ledit &'
</pre>
Then, to activate these definitions, type "source .cshrc.local".  You need
only do this the first time; when you login next time these will be defined
automatically.
<p>
When run with the above alias, L-Edit will look for and
store files in your home directory.  You can copy the MCNC
technology files to your northstar directory as follows
(ledit defaults to the file ledit.tdb on startup):
<pre>
cd
cp ~sslab/mpmems.tdb ledit.tdb
cp ~sslab/mpmems.xst mpmems.xst
</pre>
Now, the fastest way to run L-Edit is from Germain (the hp just
outside Ted Cooley's office). There you need only type
<pre>
ledit
</pre>
from an xterm window.

You can also run from any unix machine which supports x-windows;
type the following in an xterm window on your machine:
<pre>
germain
</pre>
That will bring up a new xterm window for germain.  In this new window, type
your name and password, then
<pre>
setenv DISPLAY yourmachinename:0.0
ledit
</pre>
where yourmachinename is the name of the unix machine you sat
down at.  That should do it.  If you get some message about color
scheme being wrong, you may be running another program such as netscape
which conflicts with the ledit colors; exit all other programs and
try typing "ledit" again.
