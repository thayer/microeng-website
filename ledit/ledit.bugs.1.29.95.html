<h1>L-Edit MAC 5b4.1 feedback and bugs</h1>

<p>
CROSS SECTION:    The cross section doesn't  work properly.  Most layers are
exactly
reverse of what they should be (e.g. poly looks  like a poly cut)!  The cross
section is an
extremely valuable teaching tool.   This is THE MAJOR BUG FOR US.  PLEASE FIX
THIS ASAP.
<p>
COPY CELL:  when a new name is entered for the cell to be copied, the new cell
still has
the old name (at least when copying from one file to another).
<p>
COPY CELL:  When duplicate cell exists, asked to Rename.  Responding OK always
causes a CRASH of L-Edit (error type 1).
<p>
TECHNOLOGY UNITS:  Changing the unit sizes in the Technology Parameters
 dialog box causes the Macintosh to BOMB.  E.g. start with 1IU=1 micron, then
change to 1IU=1/10 lambda.  Mouse freezes as one exits the dialog box.
<p>
HIGH PERFORMANCE GRAPHICS cause a BOMB of a powerbook 165c
<p>
COMMAND CLICK PALLET should report e.g. "show poly" below the pallet.  It says
nothing.
<p>
CONTROL CLICK doesn't add vertices to a polygon as documented.
<p>
ADD/EDIT:  use of control key to get "add/edit" button"--the label doesn't
change to indicate use.
<p>
REDRAW:  When switching between programs on Mac, the window shade function
 (system 7.5) will leave an empty L-Edit window.
<p>
L-EDIT MAC/PC TDB FILE INCOMPATABLE:  We get a format error when trying to
read a TDB file written by the MAC on the PC student version.  THis is a
particular
 problem because the student version won't read any other format than TDB.

PAN:  The "hand" here operates exactly opposite to the way it does in all other
macintosh
programs.  The convention is for the hand to drag the objects, not to move the
window.  If
you want to move the window, use another icon.
<p>
SNAP TO GRID:  Why not implement on the mac?
<p>
POSTSCRIPT PRINTING:  Why not implement on the mac?  We need to get the highest

possible quality output for making low resolution masks from a printer.  In
this regard, it
would be great to have a "print true scale" option, or "print n* scale" (for
photographic reduction).
<p>
ABORT:  IS there a way to abort a generate layers command?  There should be
an abort button for any command that takes more than half a minute!
<p>
CROSS SECTION FILES:  Opening .XST file--only works if in same directory as
device
(though the dialog box recognizes files in other directories and indicates that
they should
open (not grey), it won't open them).
<p>
SUGGESTION:  When a dialog box allows the user to select a layer from the
pallet, put
a button around the word "layer".  Clicking the button could then inform the
user that the pallet is live.
<p>
SUGGESTION:  I really got stuck trying to figure out how to copy from one file
to
another.  It's not intuitive for a mac user.  WHy not do the following:
When the copy buffer has a cell from another file, the paste command should
bring up a
warning dialog box (with optional cancel) allowing the user to verify that all
instanced
cells will also be copied, then do the copy.  If that's too hard for this
version, it should at
least bring up an explanation of how to do a copy from one file to another.
<p>
SUGGESTION--ROTATE:  An arbitrary angle rotate (such as in ClarisCAD)
would be nice.
<p>
SUGGESTION--DONGLE:  It would be more convenient if the dongle check
 happened only at application startup, not also at system startup.  If I bring
the dongle to another person's machine, we must restart the machine before
using L-Edit.
That's a real pain.
<p>
SUGGESTION--CROSS SECTION:  It would be nice if there was a way to print
 a cross section
(not just a screen dump), or better, to copy it to the clipboard.  The first
thing we wanted
to do with L-Edit was generate cross section graphics for some undergraduate
lab
writeups.  We ended up doing them from scratch in ClarisCAD instead...
<p>
NON MANHATTAN GEOMETRY:  The lack of processing in L-Edit for any non
manhattan geometry is a major disappointment for us.  Circles and polygons with
odd
angles can be drawn, but they can not be used to generate layers or  cross
sections.
I have written a Macintosh application to generate staircase (Manhattan
geometry)
circles, annuli, spokes, and teeth for L-Edit, but use of these many sided
polygons
slows down L-Edit.
