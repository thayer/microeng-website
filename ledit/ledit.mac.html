Micromachining MCNC/MUMPS folder:  mpmems.tdb, mpmems.xst (technology files for MCNC's multi-user micromachining run.  Move these files to your L-Edit folder, and rename mpmens.tdb to ledit.tdb if you plan to do micromachining design rather than VLSI design.)

<h3> WHICH MACINTOSH FILES SHOULD I DOWNLOAD AND RUN? </h3>
Start with just the L-Edit folder, and the micromachining and CircCIF 
folders if you plan 
to do micromachining design.  Come back for the L-Edit/DRC 
or L-Edit/Extract when you know you need them.  We have 
six keys to L-Edit, two to L-Edit/DRC, and one to L-Edit/Extract.  
While you can download all files, unless you are planning to 
immediately use the DRC or Extract features,  please run only L-Edit.  
This leaves the few L-Edit/DRC and L-Edit/Extract keys for those who 
really need them.
