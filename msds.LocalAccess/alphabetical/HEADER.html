<p><center><h1>Materials Safety Data Sheets</h1><p> </center>
The materials safety data sheet (MSDS) database indexed alphabetically 
below provides information needed to handle these chemicals safely.  
<p>
Only materials used by this lab are included in this list.  
<strong></strong>
This reduced database makes it easier to find the appropriate information.
Nevertheless, it is incombant on the user to verify that the form and
concentration listed in the MSDS choosen corresponds to that of the 
material in use.  MSDS sheets for some materials in the lab may not
be available here; in that case, refer to the <strong>hard copy MSDS book
</strong> located over the acid cabinet in the cleanroom.
This database is for Dartmouth use only.
