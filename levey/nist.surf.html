SURF'S UP IN NIST PHYSICS LAB; SUMMER STUDENTS

        CAN CATCH A WAVE, TRAP AN ATOM OR BUILD A BETTER DOSIMETER

<p>
     Undergraduates and graduating college seniors in science and  
engineering are invited to apply for 1995 summer research fellowships  
in physics at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.
<p>
     The SURF, or Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program,  
awards fellowships to about 20 students eah summer for
10 to 12 weeks of research in diverse areas of the NIST Physics  
Laboratory.  The program was designed to encourage female and
minority science students to pursue advanced degrees in science or  
engineering.
<p>
     "It was an idea that we hoped would address some of the issues of  
lack of diversity in the physics work force," says SURF program  
coordinator David King.  In 1993, its first year, the SURF program gave  
fellowships to 20 students from seven universities with large women and  
minority enrollments.  This
year 20 students from 11 universities received awards.
<p>
     Since the program's start, approximately half of the
40 fellowship recipients have been women.  Each summer about 40 percent  
of the students have been African American, and about 40 percent have  
been Hispanic.
<p>
     "Given the significant lack of diversity in the present
physics work force, we will aggressively seek out competitive students  
from under-represented groups or persons with disabilities," King says.
<p>
    "The overall goal is to create a more diverse pool of young talent  
in the physical sciences, predominantly physics, that may ultimately  
join the work force," says Katharine Gebbie, director
of the NIST Physics Laboratory.  "We believe that giving them a
hands-on experience working with our top scientists may stimulate them  
to pursue graduate research in physics and that ultimately they may be  
more interested in careers in science and engineering than they might  
have been without this experience."
<p>
     During their stay at NIST, SURF students are paired with
research advisers throughout the NIST Physics Laboratory based on the  
students' background and interests.  Students work with NIST
researchers on projects from radiation biophysics to solar
radiometry.  For example, some projects explored measuring
molecular forces with optical tweezers, using sucrose as a
radiation dosimeter, and measuring changes in ultraviolet radiation  
from the sun at ground level.
<p>
     The program also includes abot one week of study before
reporting to NIST in Gaithersburg, Md., an opportunity to give a  
seminar about the SURF research experience and participation in a  
scientific conference.
<p>
     Each SURF fellowship includes a $3,600 stipend as well as housing  
and transportation.  The program, supported in part by the Physics  
Division of the National Science Foundation through
its Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program, encourages  
participation of minorities and women but is open to all undergraduate  
U.S. citizens interested in a career in physics. NIST and participating  
colleges also share costs of the SURF
program.
<p>
     SURF recipients say the experience gives them an
appreciation of the breadth of career options available in
physics.  "You don't have to just narrow your career to teaching
if you don't want to because there are many other alternatives, like  
working in a place like this which I think is very interesting and very  
challenging," says Olga Batista, a 1993 SURF student from Uiversidad  
del Turabo in Puerto Rico.
<p>
     "Science is a thing you have to live and see," says Maria
Elisa Garcia, a 1993 SURF student from the University of Puerto Rico.   
"It's not only the things you read in books; you have to live it.  It's  
a real thing."
<p>
     Students receive SURF awards through nominations from their  
college or university.  Each school may nominate two candidates
plus one alternate.  Applicants must submit one signed original
and two copies of their proposal along with the federal Grant  
Application Standard Form 424.  Applications should be submitted to  
David King, NIST Physics Laboratory, B266 Physics Building,  
Gaithersburg, Md. 20899-0001, and must be received by Feb. 1, 1995.

     As a non-regulatory agency of the Commerce Department's
Technology Administration, NIST promotes U.S. economic groth by  
working with industry to develop and apply technology, measurements and  
standards.
