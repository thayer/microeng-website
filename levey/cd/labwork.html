Two extended laboratories during the first half of the course reinforce lectures by emphasizing the basics of microfabrication 
technology: film deposition (including physical and chemical deposition processes); diffusion (including film 
growth, anneal, and solid or fluid source doping); etch (including wet and dry processes); 
optical exposure; ion implantation; and materials and device characterization and evaluation.  
Hands-on demonstration of these basic techniques involves, in the first lab, 
surface micro-machined devices (such as cantilevers and resonators); in the second lab,  
bulk micro-machined devices (such as pressure sensors) are constructed. 
Both labs use prepared masks and the facilities of the Solid State Microengineering Laboratory.

A 
<a href="surface.table.html">table</a> 
shows the fabrication sequence for the surface 
micro-machining process used in the labs; 
a detailed <a href="labs/lab1/surface.html">lab writeup</a> is also available.  
One structure fabricated is the micro-cantilever.  An example cantilever is shown in
<a href=#surffig>cross-section and plan view</a> to the right. 
At the end of the quarter, after the submission of design projects, students complete their hands-on laboratories by characterizing their devices.  
This activity 'closes the loop' on these labs, and prepares them for the characterization work once their design 
projects are returned from the foundry.  Characterization includes SEM analysis.  
Students are encouraged to submit their work in HTML format, so that results can be archived for Internet access.

A similar process to that given in the
<a href="surface.table.html">table</a> 
above is used in the bulk micro-machining lab.
