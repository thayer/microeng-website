<h2>
We've learned well how to scale down electronics.  
<ul>
<li>Advantage due to small size itself (laser pointers, LEDs, hearing aids)
<p>
<li>Advantage due to large number of them (transistors in a computer)
</ul>
What does the future hold?
<ul>
<li> Smaller yet electronics (integrated circuits)
<p>
<li> Making other things small--MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS).
(Here is a MEMS <a href="http://imems.mcnc.org/imems/mpc.html">chip</a> 
that was shown on an X-files 
<a href="http://imems.mcnc.org/imems/xfiles.html">
episode</a> to represent an alien chip, 
but this chip was really made and many of the devices on it work).
<p>
Systems smaller than a hair diameter (some such machines in each category have been made by <a href="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/levey/ssml/undergradlab.html">Dartmouth students</a>):
<ul>
<li> Mechanical parts (<a href="TURBIN21.JPG">moving parts</a>, gears, motors, pushers,
<a href="http://imems.mcnc.org/imems/imems.html">accelerometers</a>
<li> Fluidic parts (<a href="fluidicamp.gif">amplifiers</a>, <a href="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/courses/es65/projects/dolan/explain.html">fluidic circuits</a>, pressure sensors, pumps, valves, 
<a href="http://www.redwoodmicro.com/flowcontrollers.html">
flow controllers</a>)
<li> Optical parts (lens 
<a href="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/levey/ssml/publications/OpticsLetters.95/OpticsLett.95.html">
correctors</a>, mirrors, ...)
<li> <a href="impedancecell.JPG">Parts that interface with biological systems</a>
(<a href="cellimpedanceclose.JPG">close-up</a>)
</ul>
</ul>
<hr>
How is it done?
<ul>
<li>
<a href=lithography.GIF>Surface Micromachining--Photolithography</a>
<li>
Cleanrooms needed when devices are smaller than dust...
</ul>
<hr>
Smaller yet?
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/images/stm10.gif">Writing with single Atoms (Xenon)</a>
<li><a href="http://www.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm/images/stm15c.gif">Stadium</a> (Iron atoms on Copper; electron waves)
<li>Molecular wires (fundamental research).
<li>More like science fiction at this time:  <a href="http://nano.xerox.com/nanotech/images/animatedBearingSmall.gif">atomic bearings</a> to be used in robots constructed an atom at a time.
</ul>
