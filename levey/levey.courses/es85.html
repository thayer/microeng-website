<FONT FACE="Times"><P>Overview of ENGS 85 - The Science of Micromachines&#9;&#9;Spring 2001&#9;Levey</P>

<P>The course will be organized as a reading course with labs.  Following some introductory lectures, reading will be assigned in the core areas below.  We will meet twice a week to discuss the reading. Students are required to bring and turn-in questions on the reading; these questions, along with some I pose will be open for discussion.  I may also assign a few problems and/or some specific group design problems at this stage.  I expect the core material to take about half the term; maybe a bit more.  </P>

<P>The second half of the term will be more like a journal club; each of us will do literature research on areas of interest, ask the others to read one paper which is particularly relevant, present the subject to the others, and all discuss the subject and the paper in particular.  MEMS is a young enough field that the primary literature is accessible to undergraduates.</P>

<P>Labs:  During the first half of the term, students will do labwork in the cleanroom.  During the second half they will be expected to complete a reasonably sophisticated design project or a somewhat simpler design project and more in depth hands-on lab research (their choice).</P>

<P>Field Trip: <a href="http://www.analog.com/industry/iMEMS/mpd/p_division.html">Analog Devices MEMS line</a>, Cambridge MA.</P>
