	Extended (Bloch) states in an infinite periodic solid are the standard basis
set for  solid state physics.  At another extreme, wavefunctions confined in a
Coulomb potential are the basis for the electronic states of atomic physics.
In this course we will investigate how our picture of solids changes in systems
where excitations are best thought of as confined (narrow band) in one or more
directions and extended (broad band) in the other directions.  We will begin
with a survey of the field, including fabrication techniques and an
introduction to some of the differences between three dimensional (3D) solids
and quasi zero-, one-, and two- dimensional systems.   While  artificially
layered (2D) systems have been most extensively studied,  we will also place an
emphasis on molecular wires and artificial quantum wire systems (1D).  We will
consider both standard quantum confinement and the topological effects of
reduced dimensionality.<p>

	Following this introduction (half the term) the seminar will be organized as a journal club,
with members of the class presenting material from current, classic, and review
articles.  The level may range from that of Scientific American to Physical
Review Letters.   The subject of reduced dimensionality in solids is
intentionally broad and covers many "hot topics" in condensed matter physics.
I hope we can stimulate discussion on the similarities and differences in a
broad range of effects while also concentrating on the subjects which most
interest those present.  In addition to the pursuing the rich literature on
quantum wells and superlattices,  we may discuss articles on the following:
microcrystallite doped glasses (0D);  arrays of quantum boxes (0D);  quantum
transport, Coulomb blockades and conductance fluctuations in mesoscopic
electronic devices; organic semiconductors (1D); high Tc  superconductors as
natural 2D systems;  anyon (fractional) statistics (as opposed to Fermi-Dirac
or Bose-Einstein statistics) (2D); the quantum Hall effect (2D); and "fluxonic"
(vs. electronic) circuits (2D).  Both theory and experimental technique are
appropriate.<p>
<p>
	Course obligations are (a) attendance, and (b) participation in the journal
club.  Class meeting times will be arranged (perhaps 2A).   Our first meeting
will be Thursday, September 26 at 2pm in 210 Wilder.  <p>
<p>
	My  hope is that the journal club may continue beyond the duration of this
course (perhaps on a once a month basis).<p>
