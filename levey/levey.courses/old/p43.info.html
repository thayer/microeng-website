Discussion       For each Friday class, you must read the indicated material
and be ready to<p>
Preparation:     summarize the key points.  You must also bring in writing
(<b>to be turned in)</b> at least <b>three  good questions on the material</b>.
The questions and summaries will form a base from which to start our
discussion.  Critical reading always raises  questions, and is an important
part of learning.  Think especially about how this material may relate to
material you have seen in this and other courses, or to experiences you have in
everyday life.  Think about what various results mean in extreme limits.
Examples of good questions:  eqn 2.2 looks like a binomial coefficient; is
there a relationship between this probability and a binomial expansion?  or,
considering eqn. 1.5,  if T--&gt;0, does V vanish?--what happens to the gas
molecules if there is no volume?  Good questions usually take some thought.  An
example of a poor question is:  How does one get from eqn x.y to eqn x.y+1 in
the text (a better question would be:  I've worked out the implications of eqn
x.y, and I can only get x.y+1 by making assumption zz; is this really
necessary, and is it valid?).<p>

Homework:	Due as shown on course outline (usually on Mondays) at the
<i>BEGINNING </i>
<i>of class.</i> <b>Late homework</b> (up to 1 week late) normally<b> counts
@50%.</b>  <p>

Exams:	One midterm and one final.<p>

Honor Principle:	It is expected that you have all read and understand the Academic
Honor Principle.  Note that you are bound to take some action if you witness an
apparent violation.  In the context of this course:<p>
Exams:	The following will be on each exam cover sheet:  "You are allowed to
bring in and use  a calculator and one 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper with whatever
notes you like on both sides.  You may not consult any other source or person
(except the instructor) during the exam."<p>
Homework:	You may <b>not </b>directly <i>copy</i> another student's work.  You
may <b>not </b><i>consult</i> another student's work <i>without their knowledge
and permission</i>.  However, you <b>are encouraged</b> to consult with other
students in the problem solving process (this is facilitated by working in the
same room; I'd suggest 210 Wilder).  You will learn the most by working as much
as you can on your own first, then consulting with others on the parts you or
they can't get.  One bottom line is this:  <b>in the end </b>(after any
consultation)<b> you must be able to work through on your own whatever you turn
in.</b><p>
