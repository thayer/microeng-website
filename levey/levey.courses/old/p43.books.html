<p>
Most texts take one of two approaches.  <p>
1.	The historic approach is to develop the laws of thermodynamics as a self
consistent phenomenological theory, leading to a good intuition for the
macroscopic principles, and a skill in solving many real world problems.  Once
the thermodynamic theory is complete, the microscopic origin of these empirical
laws are explained through statistical mechanics.  <p>
2.	An integrated approach is taken, developing the laws of thermodynamics along
side of their microscopic interpretation.  This has  aesthetic appeal to the
physicist who wants to get to the bottom of why the world behaves as it does.
Our text takes this approach.<p>
<p>
*Born,M, <b>Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance</b> (Oxford, 1951)
QC/6/B645n<p>
	Ch. 5-7.  Interesting section on discovery of Planck's law by a master of
physics.<p>
<p>
Callen,H.B., <b>Thermodynamics and an introduction to thermostatistics</b> 2nd
ed. (Wiley, 1985) QC/311/C25/1985.  An excellent treatment of thermodynamics,
followed by a shorter section on its statistical mechanical underpinning.  <p>
<p>
Crawford, F. W. <b>Heat, Thermodynamics, and Statistical Physics</b> (Harcourt,
1963) QC/254/C7<p>
<p>
*Feynman, R.P., <b>Fennman Lectures, V1</b>  (Addison Wesley, 1966) QC/23/F47<p>
	Ch. 39-46 of Volume 1 are relevant to this course, but the whole series is
highly recommended for any aspiring physicist.  Good insight, frequently a
unique point of view.<p>
<p>
Gibbs, J. Willard, <b>Statistical Mechanics </b>(OxBow Press 1981 reprint of
1901 classic) QC/174.8/.G52/1981/cop.1.<p>
  Gives a flavor of how far statistical mechanics had developed by the turn of
the century.   Written by the brilliant American scientist who first applied
the ergodic postulate (and the chemical potential).<p>
<p>
Goodstein, D.L. <b>States of Matter</b> (Prentice-Hall, 1975) QC/173.3/G66<p>
	Good section on phase transitions.<p>
<p>
*Guenault, T. <b>Statistical Physics</b> (Routledge, 1988) QC/174.8/G84/1988<p>
	An excellent and concise book, but it <u>assumes a prior knowledge of
thermodynamics.</u>  The excellent companion book, Thermal Physics by C. B. P.
Finn is currently not in the Dartmouth library.<u></u><p>
<u></u><p>
Huang, K. <b>Statistical Mechanics</b> 2nd ed.(Wiley, c1987)
QC/174.8/H83/1987<p>
	A good text at a <u>much more advanced level than P43</u>.  Includes a nice
review of  classical thermodynamics, and a good treatment of transport
(non-equlibrium situations).<p>
<p>
*Kittel, C. <b>Elementary Statistical Mechanics</b> (Wiley, 1958)
QC/175/K652e<p>
	<p>
*Kittel and Kroemer <b>Thermal Physics</b> (Freeman, 1980)  QC/311.5/K52/1980<p>
	An introduction at about our level.  Occasionally oversimplified.  Text for
P43 last year. <p>
<p>
Landau,L and Lifshitz, E. M. <b>Statistical Physics</b><p>
	A classic but at a <u>more advanced level </u>than this course.<p>
<p>
*Lay, J. E. <b>Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Matter, An
Introductory Survey</b> (Harper &amp; Row, 1990) (personal copy on reserve)<p>
	A good introduction at the level of Mandl, but with a broader coverage and a
stronger materials emphasis. Also includes sections on information theory,
fluctuations, fluids, transport, Monte Carlo simulation, and semiconductor
devices.<p>
<p>
Leff, H. S.  and Rex, A. F.  <b>Maxwell's Demon-- Entropy, Information,
Computing</b> (Princeton Unversityh Press, 1990)  QC/318/M35/M38/1990<p>
	An interesting collection of articles covering a wide range of topics from the
challenges to the second law of thermodynamics to fundamental limits in the
size and speed of computers.  <p>
<p>
*Mandl, F. <b>Statistical Physics,  </b>2nd ed.<b> </b> (Wiley, c1988)
QC/174.8/M27/1988<p>
	Our text for P43.  It does an excellent job of combining equilibrium
statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.  At the level of Reif's Fundamentals,
but a somewhat cleaner treatment.<p>
<p>
Nash, L. K. <b>Elements of Statistical Thermodynamics</b> (Addison Wesley,
1970) QC/311/N3<p>
<p>
*Pippard, A. B. <b>The Elements of Classical Thermodynamics</b> (Cambridge,
1957)QC/311/P662e<p>
	A classic treatment of thermodynamic phenomena without reference to their a
statistical origin.<p>
<p>
Reif, F. <b>Statistical Physics</b> (McGraw-Hill, c1965) QC/21/B4445/v.5<p>
	Introduction at a <u>more elementary level</u> than P43.  Probably the least
exciting of the Berkeley physics series (the Waves and E&amp;M books in this
series are superb).<p>
<p>
*Reif, F. <b>Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics</b> (McGraw Hill,
1965) QC/175/R43<p>
	Covers a wider range of subjects  than our text, but somewhat at the expense
of a cohesive story.  Old (1965), but probably <i>the most widely used text
</i>(used here for years, incl.'91).<p>
<p>
*Reichl, L. E. <b>A modern course in statistical physics </b>(University of
Texas Press, 1980). QC/174.8/R44<p>
	More advanced than our text, but well written and introductory sections are
good as a review.  Segregates thermodynamics and SM.  Includes interesting
modern topics.<p>
<p>
Sklar, Lawrence.  <b>Physics and Chance: philosophical issues in the
foundations of statistical mechanics</b>  (Cambridge University Press, 1993)
QC/174.8/S55/1993<p>
	Fascinating account of historical and contemporary research on philosophical
issues of SM, such as the direction of time, Maxwell and Loschmidt demons,
cosmology, ergodicity, ... Quite accessible at the level of this course.  Deep
arguments, but few equations.<p>
<p>
E. Schrodinger  <b>Statistical Thermodynamics</b> (Cambridge,1952)
QC/311/S38/1952<p>
	A 1944 seminar series one of the original thinkers in quantum mechanics.<p>
<p>
M. W. Zemansky <b>Heat and Thermodynamics 6th ed.</b> (McGraw-Hill, c1981)
QC/254.2/Z45/18981<p>
