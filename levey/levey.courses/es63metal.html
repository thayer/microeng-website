<h1> Grain Growth in Aluminum Metallization Lines</h1>
Aluminum metallization layers are used on many semiconducting devices.  In this
project, aluminum lines approximately 2 microns wide will be laid down on a
silicon oxide substrate using the facilities in the
<a href="/levey/ssml/home.html">Thayer Microengineering
Laboratory.</a>
The structure of the films in as-deposited condition and after various
heat treatments will be examined using scanning electron microscopy.  A
good project will determine the evolution of the microstructure as a
function of time at a particular annealing temperature.  The
structure and rate of grain growth in the lines produced
from Al-4 wt.% Cu and Al-1 wt. %  Si could also be studied and
compared to grain growth in pure aluminum.
