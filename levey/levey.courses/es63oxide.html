<h1> Oxide Growth on Silicon </h1>
Oxide films are grown on
silicon wafers to provide insulating layers in
semiconductor devices.  In this project, performed in the
<a href="/microengineering/home.html">Thayer Microengineering
Laboratory </a>,
oxide films will be grown on
silicon by both wet and dry oxidation.  The film thickness will be
measured as a function of annealing time at a veriety of temperatures
by both ellipsometry, and optionally using a profilometer and/or a
scanning electron microscope.  A good project will derive a
relationship between oxide thickness, annealing time and annealing temperature.
<p>
Silicon wafers are processed using an
<a href="/microengineering/equipment/RCA/RCA.hood.html">RCA clean</a>
and oxidized in a
<a href="/microengineering/equipment/furnace/furnace.html">diffusion furnace </a>
or a
<a href="/microengineering/equipment/RTA/RTA.html">rapid thermal processor</a>
(RTP) in either flowing oxygen gas or
<a href="/microengineering/equipment/furnace/bubbler.html">water vapor</a>.
Oxide thickness is measured with a dual wavelength
<a href="/microengineering/map/ellipsometer">ellipsometer</a>
and/or by etching and using a stylus profilometer.  Surfaces can also be
examined with a <a href="/microengineering/equipment/SEM/SEM_intro.html">
Scanning Electron Microscope</a> (SEM).
