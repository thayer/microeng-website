<tt>  Abstract:  The  authors  review the nonlinear-optical effects observed
at</tt><p>
<tt>room temperature in semiconductor quantum-well structures photoexcited
near</tt><p>
<tt>the  band  gap.  A comprehensive discussion of optical transitions in
these</tt><p>
<tt>microstructures  is  given,  including  excitonic  effects and the
specific</tt><p>
<tt>features    of    room-temperature    exciton    resonances.
Experimental</tt><p>
<tt>investigations  using  continuous-wave,  picosecond-, and
femtosecond-laser</tt><p>
<tt>sources  are  presented. They show extremely efficient nonlinear
processes.</tt><p>
<tt>In   the   case   of   excitations   that   are   long  compared  with
the</tt><p>
<tt>exciton-ionization  time,  the induced changes in absorption and
refraction</tt><p>
<tt>do  not  depend  on  the wavelength or on the duration of excitation.
These</tt><p>
<tt>changes  depend only on the density of absorbed photons and are
interpreted</tt><p>
<tt>in  terms  of electron-hole plasma screening and band filling. In
contrast,</tt><p>
<tt>for  ultrashort  excitation,  nonlinear  processes depend critically on
the</tt><p>
<tt>excitation  wavelength.  The  selective  generation of excitons is found
to</tt><p>
<tt>produce  effects  larger than a plasma of the same density. This
unexpected</tt><p>
<tt>result is shown to arise from the low temperature of the exciton gas
before</tt><p>
<tt>it  interacts  with  the lattice and from the decrease of screening that
is</tt><p>
<tt>the reduced dimensionality of quantum-well structures.  (77

<tt>  Abstract: The authors review some of the properties of quantum well
laser</tt><p>
<tt>(QWLs),  with emphasis on the two-dimensional origins of these. It is
shown</tt><p>
<tt>that  two  main effects determine the lowering of threshold current,
namely</tt><p>
<tt>the  diminished  density  of  states  (DOS)  (favourable  factor)  and
the</tt><p>
<tt>diminished  optical confinement (unfavorable factor). The good operation
of</tt><p>
<tt>GaAs-GaAlAs  QWLs  also relies on more subtle effects such as the square
2D</tt><p>
<tt>DOS, the enhanced optical matrix element, the high quantum efficiency . .
.</tt><p>
<tt>The  poor  operation  of  GaInAs  based  quantum  well lasers is due to
the</tt><p>
<tt>detrimental  Auger  effect which is larger than in 3D lasers because of
the</tt><p>
<tt>higher  carrier  densities  at  which  QWLs  operate.  Several other
useful</tt><p>
<tt>properties  of  QWLs  in  the performance (high-frequency, narrow-line)
and</tt><p>
<tt>manufacturing  fields  are  discussed.  Problems and advantages of 1 and
0D</tt><p>
<tt>quantum-wire and quantum-box lasers are briefly evaluated.  (34

<tt>  Abstract:  The  authors  review  the theory of semiconductor
superlattice</tt><p>
<tt>electronic  structure.  First a survey of theoretical methods is
presented.</tt><p>
<tt>These  methods  can  be  divided  into  two  general classes: the
supercell</tt><p>
<tt>approach  in  which  the  superlattice is viewed as a material with a
large</tt><p>
<tt>unit cell, and the boundary-condition approach in which bulk wave
functions</tt><p>
<tt>in   the   constituent  semiconductors  are  matched  at  the
superlattice</tt><p>
<tt>interfaces.  Supercell  approaches are essentially the same as
conventional</tt><p>
<tt>band-structure   methods.   They   can   only   be  applied  to
thin-layer</tt><p>
<tt>superlattices  because  of  numerical cost. The authors discuss problems
of</tt><p>
<tt>interface  matching  that  occur  in various boundary-condition methods
and</tt><p>
<tt>relate  these methods to each other. A particular boundary-condition
method</tt><p>
<tt>is  used to discuss the electronic structure of various III-V
semiconductor</tt><p>
<tt>superlattices. Emphasis is placed on discussing the qualitatively
different</tt><p>
<tt>behavior  that  can  arise because of different energy-band lineups,
strain</tt><p>
<tt>conditions,  and  growth  orientations.  The authors compare the results
of</tt><p>
<tt>three  commonly  used  boundary-condition  methods  and find generally
good</tt><p>
<tt>agreement.  (209 Refs)</tt><p>

<tt>  Abstract:  The  problem  of  the one-dimensional hydrogen atom has
evoked</tt><p>
<tt>interest  because  of its relevance to the behavior of hydrogeniclike
atoms</tt><p>
<tt>in  the  presence  of  strong  magnetic fields and of hydrogenic
impurities</tt><p>
<tt>confined  in  quantum-well  wire  structures.  The  binding  energy  of
the</tt><p>
<tt>one-dimensional nonrelativistic hydrogen atom has been found to be
infinite</tt><p>
<tt>in  its  ground  state.  The  authors solved the relativistic hydrogen
atom</tt><p>
<tt>problem  for the one-dimensional case using the Klein-Gordon equation.
They</tt><p>
<tt>find  that  the  binding energy in the ground state for the
one-dimensional</tt><p>
<tt>relativistic  hydrogen  atom  is  finite  and  is of order of the rest
mass</tt><p>
<tt>energy  of  the  electron.  Therefore  a relativistic treatment removes

<tt>  Abstract:  A  brief  review  is presented of the novel physics
associated</tt><p>
<tt>with  submicrometre  structures  produced  by  molecular  beam  epitaxy
and</tt><p>
<tt>electron beam lithography. In low-temperature transport, the most
important</tt><p>
<tt>effect is the achievement of extraordinary long coherence lengths (10 mu
m)</tt><p>
<tt>or  high  mobilities  for carriers moving in two dimensions and
constructed</tt><p>
<tt>topologies.   Ballistic   motion,   fractional  quantum  Hall  effect,

is</tt><p>

In</tt><p>

well</tt><p>
<tt>confinement,  giving  rise to sharp inter-subband transitions and

<tt>   Abstract:  The  authors consider a one-dimensional periodic potential,
or</tt><p>
<tt>superlattice,  in  monocrystalline  semiconductors  formed  by  a
periodic</tt><p>
<tt>variation  of  alloy  composition  or of impurity density introduced
during</tt><p>
<tt>epitaxial  growth.  If the period of a superlattice, of the order of
100AA,</tt><p>
<tt>is shorter than the electron mean free path, a series of narrow allowed
and</tt><p>
<tt>forbidden  bands is expected owing to the subdivision of the Brillouin
zone</tt><p>
<tt>into  a  series  of  minizones. If the scattering time of electrons meets
a</tt><p>
<tt>threshold  condition, the combined effect of the narrow energy band and
the</tt><p>
<tt>narrow  wave-vector zone makes it possible for electrons to be excited
with</tt><p>
<tt>moderate  electric  fields  to  an energy and momentum beyond an

<tt>XXAB The adiabatic quantum transport in multiply connected systems is
examined.</tt><p>
<tt>The systems considered have several holes, usually three or more, threaded
by</tt><p>
<tt>independent flux tubes, the transport properties of which are described
by</tt><p>
<tt>matrix-valued functions of the fluxes. The main theme is the</tt><p>
<tt>differential-geometric interpretation of Kubo's formulas as curvatures.
Because</tt><p>
<tt>of this interpretation, and because flux space can be identified with
the</tt><p>
<tt>multitorus, the adiabatic conductances have topological significance,
related</tt><p>
<tt>to the first Chern character. In particular, they have quantized averages.
The</tt><p>
<tt>authors describe various classes of quantum Hamiltonians that describe
multiply</tt><p>
<tt>connected systems and investigate their basic properties. They concentrate
on</tt><p>
<tt>models that reduce to the study of finite-dimensional matrices. In
particular,</tt><p>
<tt>the reduction of the ``free-electron'' Schrodinger operator, on a network
of</tt><p>
<tt>thin wires, to a matrix problem is described in detail. The authors
define</tt><p>
<tt>``loop currents'' and investigate their properties and their dependence on
the</tt><p>
<tt>choice of flux tubes. They introduce a method of topological classification
of</tt><p>
<tt>networks according to their transport. This leads to the analysis of
level</tt><p>
<tt>crossings and to the association of ``charges'' with crossing points.
Networks</tt><p>
<tt>made with three equilateral triangles are investigated and classified,
both</tt><p>
<tt>numerically and analytically. Many of these networks turn out to
have</tt><p>
<tt>nontrivial topological transport properties for both the free-electron and
the</tt><p>
<tt>tight-binding models. The authors conclude with some open problems
and</tt><p>
<tt>questions.</tt><p>

<tt>  Abstract:   Under   certain   conditions,   high  magnetic  fields  in
a</tt><p>
<tt>two-dimensional  conductor  lead  to  a  suppression  of  both  elastic
and</tt><p>
<tt>inelastic backscattering. This, together with the formation of edge
states,</tt><p>
<tt>is  used  to  develop  a picture of the integer quantum Hall effect in
open</tt><p>
<tt>multiprobe  conductors.  The  authors  consider both ideal contacts
without</tt><p>
<tt>elastic  scattering  and  also disordered contacts. Ideal contacts
populate</tt><p>
<tt>edge  states  equally  whereas  disordered  contacts  lead  to  an
initial</tt><p>
<tt>nonequilibrium  population  of the edge states. In Hall samples much
larger</tt><p>
<tt>than  an  inelastic length, and in the presence of disordered contacts,
the</tt><p>
<tt>sample edges become equipotential lines only an inelastic scattering
length</tt><p>
<tt>away  from  the current source and current drain contacts. Samples so
small</tt><p>
<tt>that  the  carriers  can  travel  from  one  contact  to  the other
without</tt><p>
<tt>inelastic  relaxation do not exhibit exact quantization if the contacts
are</tt><p>
<tt>disordered. In all cases they find that the quantum Hall effect occurs
only</tt><p>
<tt>if  the sample exhibits at least two sets of equilibrated edge states
which</tt><p>
<tt>do  not  interact  via  elastic  or  inelastic  scattering.  The  onset
of</tt><p>
<tt>interaction  between  the  two sets of edge states leads to deviations
from</tt><p>
<tt>exact  quantization  and  eventually  to  a  breakdown  of the quantum

<tt>  Abstract:   Reviews   some  of  the  recent  surprising  theoretical
and</tt><p>
<tt>experimental   results  obtained  on  the  transport  properties  of
small</tt><p>
<tt>disordered  metal  samples.  Even  in the presence of disorder, the
quantum</tt><p>
<tt>mechanical  interference  of  electron wavefunctions can still be
observed.</tt><p>
<tt>The  Aharonov-Bohm effect is a particularly clear demonstration of this.
In</tt><p>
<tt>doubly  connected structures (such as loops of wire) threaded by a
magnetic</tt><p>
<tt>flux,  the  electrical  conductance oscillates because of the
Aharonov-Bohm</tt><p>
<tt>effect.  In  fact,  because  the  electron trajectories are diffusive
(i.e.</tt><p>
<tt>random walks), even a lone wire (a singly connected structure) will
exhibit</tt><p>
<tt>a  random pattern of conductance fluctuations as a function of the
magnetic</tt><p>
<tt>field  because  of  the same interference effects. All that is required
for</tt><p>
<tt>the  observation of these interferences is that the electrons retain
'phase</tt><p>
<tt>memory'  during  the  period of transit through the sample. The length
over</tt><p>
<tt>which  memory is maintained (the phase coherence length) can be much
larger</tt><p>
<tt>than  the  random  walk step length (the mean free path). The authors
focus</tt><p>
<tt>mainly on effects observed in the limit where the phase coherence length
of</tt><p>
<tt>the electrons is comparable to or larger than the sample size. They
explain</tt><p>
<tt>how the interferences are averaged as the system size grows larger than
the</tt><p>
<tt>phase  coherence  length.  They  also  remark  on surprising aspects of
the</tt><p>
<tt>fluctuations  such  as  those resulting from the non-local character of
the</tt><p>
<tt>wavefunction; some of the results are forbidden classically.  (152

<tt>  Abstract:  The  low-temperature  conducting properties of

<tt>are  observed to vary in a random manner as a function of magnetic field
or</tt><p>
<tt>carrier    density.    These    fluctuations   are   sample-specific,
but</tt><p>
<tt>time-independent  and  reproducible  within  a  given  sample.  It  is
now</tt><p>
<tt>understood  that these fluctuations result from random quantum
interference</tt><p>
<tt>of diffusing electrons. The author reviews the recently-developed theory
of</tt><p>
<tt>these  novel  fluctuation  phenomena,  which  predict  that  the  order
of</tt><p>
<tt>magnitude  of  the absolute fluctuations in the conductance of any
metallic</tt><p>

a</tt><p>
<tt>multi-probe geometry are discussed, and some recent results relevant to

these</tt><p>

<tt>is reviewed, and a decisive experiment for testing the theory is
proposed.</tt><p>

<tt>XXAB The concept of electrical duality is reviewed, with a focus on the
symmetry</tt><p>
<tt>between the motion of charge and the motion of magnetic flux. This approach
is</tt><p>
<tt>especially illuminating for the case of a superconductor, in which flux
is</tt><p>
<tt>quantized in units of Phi [sub 0]=h/2e. In a two-dimensional</tt><p>
<tt>superconductor, a quantized vortex or fluxon can be viewed as the dual of
an</tt><p>
<tt>electron. Based on this analogy, new superconducting ``fluxonic''
device</tt><p>
<tt>concepts are proposed, including optical detectors and transistors.
Finally, the</tt><p>
<tt>implications of this picture for low- and high-temperature superconductors
are</tt><p>
<tt>evaluated.</tt><p>

<tt>  Abstract:  The  authors  predict  two  distinct  types  of crossovers
and</tt><p>
<tt>fundamental   quantum-noise  limits  that  single-electron-tunneling
(SET)</tt><p>
<tt>statistics in an ultrasmall normal tunnel junction will exhibit as
external</tt><p>
<tt>macroscopic  conditions  are  changed. When the product of source voltage
V</tt><p>
<tt>and  electrostatic  capacitance  C  of  the  junction  is given, SET
events</tt><p>
<tt>exhibit   a   crossover   from   random  shot  noise  to
Coulomb-regulated</tt><p>
<tt>oscillations  as the ratio of source-to-tunnel resistance R/sub S//R/sub
T/</tt><p>
<tt>becomes  larger.  This  regularity, however, has a fundamental upper
bound,</tt><p>
<tt>which  the authors refer to as the standard quantum limit. It is shown
that</tt><p>
<tt>the  standard  quantum  limit  does  not originate from the current or
from</tt><p>
<tt>thermal  fluctuations  but  originates  from  the  time-energy
uncertainty</tt><p>
<tt>principle  that is inherent in quantum-mechanical tunneling. In
particular,</tt><p>
<tt>the  time-energy  uncertainty  relationship is derived this being unique
to</tt><p>
<tt>single-electron  tunneling by Coulomb blockade. On the other hand, when
the</tt><p>
<tt>ratio  to  source-to-tunnel  resistance  R/sub S//R/sub T/, is given, it
is</tt><p>
<tt>found  that  the  degree of randomness of SET oscillations decreases as
the</tt><p>
<tt>product  CV  reduces  to  an  optimum  value above e/2, but that it
rapidly</tt><p>
<tt>increases as the product further reduces towards e/2. Such an optimum
value</tt><p>
<tt>is  shown to emerge as a balancing point between an ordering force
(arising</tt><p>
<tt>from    Coulomb    blockade)   and   a   fluctuating   force   (caused
by</tt><p>
<tt>quantum-mechanical  tunneling).  The optimum value is numerically
evaluated</tt><p>
<tt>over  a  wide  range  of  the  ratio  R/sub S//R/sub T/. The whole
analysis</tt><p>
<tt>employs  a  semiclassical  model  but  it  is  based  on an exact,
analytic</tt><p>
<tt>methodology.   By   so  doing,  a  critical  point  is  reached  where

In</tt><p>

recent</tt><p>
<tt>amendments to this have been included, taking into account the techniques
of</tt><p>
<tt>random matrix theory and effects of the spin-orbit interaction. A
general</tt><p>
<tt>review of experimental work is presented in order to permit a
comprehensive</tt><p>
<tt>evaluation of current understanding of the quantum size effect on
the</tt><p>
<tt>electronic spectrum. This survey includes magnetic susceptibility,
nuclear</tt><p>
<tt>magnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, heat capacity, optical,
and</tt><p>
<tt>infrared absorption measurements. These are discussed in many instances
from</tt><p>
<tt>the point of view of there being competing size effects arising from a
reduced</tt><p>
<tt>volume contrasted with those from the surface. A number of stimulating
and</tt><p>
<tt>provocative results have led to the development of new areas of
research</tt><p>
<tt>involving metallic clusters such as cluster beam techniques,
far-infrared</tt><p>
<tt>absorption by particle clusters, adsorbate NMR, and particle-matrix
composites.</tt><p>
<tt>Although there is little question that the experiments themselves indicate
the</tt><p>
<tt>existence of quantum effects, there are as yet, insufficient results to
test</tt><p>
<tt>the theoretical predictions for electron-level distribution functions based

<tt>XXAB An attempt is made to develop a description of the multielectron
quantum</tt><p>
<tt>state responsible for the integral quantum Hall effect. One goal is to
provide</tt><p>
<tt>intuitive support for the very powerful and general argument of Laughlin
that</tt><p>
<tt>the theoretical relationship is insensitive to complicating details in
the</tt><p>
<tt>interior of the sample. The model the author uses is somewhat more
realistic</tt><p>
<tt>than heretofore in that it is three dimensional, does not ignore the
atomic</tt><p>
<tt>structure of the bulk matter, and does not use an effective-mass
approximation.</tt><p>
<tt>In order to treat the problem quantum mechanically, the complete
system,</tt><p>
<tt>including circuitry external to the system of interest, is replaced by a
model</tt><p>
<tt>closed system consisting of a finite number of electrons. In this model,
states</tt><p>
<tt>with a finite Hall current and voltage are metastable against decay</tt><p>
<tt>caused by interactions outside the model, such as those with bulk
matter</tt><p>
<tt>excitations. Such states describe the true situation well only in
the</tt><p>
<tt>conductivity plateaus; between plateaus, there would be current flow
between</tt><p>
<tt>the Hall voltage probes corresponding to decaying states.
Experimental</tt><p>
<tt>constraints replace this transverse current by a voltage drop along
the</tt><p>
<tt>direction of current flow. The interactions between the electrons are
expressed</tt><p>
<tt>in terms of a self-consistent potential which gives an
independent-particle</tt><p>
<tt>description as a starting point, and residual interactions which are
treated by</tt><p>
<tt>perturbation theory. The self-consistent potential is found to be important
in</tt><p>
<tt>understanding the properties of the quantum state of the system, such as
the</tt><p>
<tt>existence of the plateaus in conductivity and how the electrons in
the</tt><p>
<tt>(effective) two-dimensional region come to equilibrium with the different
Fermi</tt><p>
<tt>levels in the voltage probes. To all finite orders of perturbation theory,
the</tt><p>
<tt>residual interactions are found not to alter the quantized Hall
conductivity.</tt><b></b><p>
