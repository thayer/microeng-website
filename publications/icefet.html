	The electrical properties of ice/solid interface were considered 
theoretically, and studying experimentally using the field 
transistor technique[1]. 
The theoretical approach generalizes the linear[2] and partial[1] solutions 
reported before. The system of nonlinear equations is solved numerically 
and approximations are obtained for the most important cases. The relationship 
between the perpendicular electric field, E, applied to the crystal,  
configurational vector, [OMEGA], electric charge densities, ni, and surface 
conductivity, [SIGMA]s, is obtained. The thickness of the surface layer in 
which the electric charge density substantially differs from the value in the 
bulk of ice is expressed in terms of the layer capacitance, and surface 
conductivity. We used a field effect transistor made of ice to determine the 
DC and AC surface conductivity, and the electric capacitance of the ice/SiO2 
interface in a wide temperature range. The thickness and the electric charge 
density of this interfacial layer were obtained. The paper discusses the 
important role that this electrical layer plays in forming the structure and 
physical properties of a liquid-like layer on the ice surface.
