<strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
When a confocal fluorescence microscope with a high numerical aperture
oil immersion objective is focused deep into an aqueous medium,
aberrations result which weaken and blur the observed image.
We have designed and fabricated a simple, two-level binary phase
mask which partially corrects these aberrations, improving
image brightness and resolution.  The mask design and some
confirming results are presented in this letter.
