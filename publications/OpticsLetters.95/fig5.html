Fig. 5.  Averaged axial intensity of ensembles of 140-nm beads at 40 micro-meters depth in water.  Optical sections were taken every 200nm at the stage (160nm in water); [[Delta]] z is measured at the stage (i.e., toil).  Solid curve, average of 20 beads imaged with the binary corrector; dashed curve, average of 14 beads imaged without the corrector.  Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.  The FWHM is improved by approximately 50% from ~1.5 to ~0.7 micro-meters.
