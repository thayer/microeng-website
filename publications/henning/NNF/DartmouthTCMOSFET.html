<ul>
<li>There is a growing need for embedded sensors, particularly for 'smart maintenance' applications.
<li>Desirable parameters for sensing include temperature, pressure, flow, viscosity, acidity, and opacity.
<li>There is a particular need to determine when tribological coatings fail, or (better) are about to fail.
<li>Temperatures measured beneath thin film frictional coatings provide a signature for coating failure.
<li>Arrays of temperature sensors are beneficial for this application.
<li>Thermocouples are rugged temperature sensors, but large arrays of thermocouples create interconnection and signal access problems.
<li>This work uses MOSFETs as a means to reduce wire counts, and provide access to only desired locations, in arrays of thermocouples.
