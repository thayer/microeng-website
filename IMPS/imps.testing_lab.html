<P>Thursday 3/6/97, 2-6pm, 221 Cummings Hall</B></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>Now it is time to test the "IMPS CHIP" you
made.  You will be provided with a variety of test
equipment.  This handout is primarily a set of condensed
manuals for this equipment; it is up to you to decide
what your device is to be used for and how to connect
and test it for this use.  Perhaps you already have
ideas; if not, think about it in light of the manuals
below and then discuss it with one of the lab assistants.
 Some of the manuals have some suggested measurements
(indicated with a bullet *) to get you going.

<P>We suggest you work in groups of three or four; this
will allow you to compare results and ideas with classmates.
  In addition to testing your results in small groups,
we'd like to suggest a class wide project to determine
the resistivity of Copper/Nickel films as a function
of composition.  We'll attempt to put together one
large plot of resistivity verses nickel concentration;
each data point will be somebody's sample.

<P>Good luck!  By the way, what is that triangle mystery
device, anyhow?  And why are its contact pads spaced
the way they are?

<P><B><CENTER>Digital Multimeter (Fluke 45 or Keithley 169)</B></CENTER>

<P>You have seen a digital multimeter already in your DC
circuits lab; much of this section will be a review.
 It can measure electrical potential (VOLTS), current
(AMPERES), or resistance (OHMS).  Two wires connect
the multimeter to metal probes, which in turn can be
used to contact your circuit.   One probe is black
(LO, COM,  or negative), the other red (HI or positive).

<P>KEITHLEY:  The AC/DC button should be out to measure
DC.  You need to select a full scale range appropriate
to the measurement you expect (e.g. for a 9V battery,
 press the third dark brown button to select a 20V
full scale range).

<P>FLUKE:  AC is indicated by ~, DC by --.  The meter is
auto scaling.

<P>VOLTMETER:  Press  and V ( or V--) button, and connect
the leads across your circuit to measure DC volts.
 * As a review, check the "voltage", i.e.
the electrical potential across the transistor radio
battery (a nominal 9 volts) and determine which battery
terminal is positive.  Some batteries have a resistor
connected to one terminal. * If you measure the voltage
between the free battery terminal and the free end
of the resistor, you will also see the full battery
voltage, but if you take that free end of the resistor
and touch it to the other battery terminal, the voltage
you measure will decrease a little.  * Why is this?
 You may  use the voltmeter as part of a 4 point resistivity
measurement (described below).

<P>OHMMETER:  Press the <font face="symbol">W</font> button, and connect the leads
across your device to measure DC resistance.  The meter
will attempt to force a current through the leads and
your circuit, measure the resulting voltage drop, and
display the resistance as calculated by ohm's law.
 *You can use ohmmeter to check which parts of the
device you  made are connected together (low resistance),
and which are isolated from each other.  With the smallest
devices, is possible that two features that should
be isolated are actually shorted together due to a
defect in the photolithography or electroplating.
Check for this.

<P>AMMETER:  Press the A (or A--) button.   DO NOT place
the ammeter across the battery or power supply.  To
measure DC current in your circuit, you must break
a connection in the circuit and insert the ammeter.
  Consider the circuit of your batter connected to
each end of a resistor.  To measure the current, disconnect
one end of the battery from the resistor and connect
one ammeter lead to the free side of the battery and
the other to the free side of the resistor.  You may
use the ammeter as part of a 4 point resistivity measurement
(described below).

<P><B><CENTER>Scribe Station (Isolating your device)</B></CENTER>

<P>For the electroplating to work, all the devices had
to be linked to the outside of the plate so that current
could flow to the device.  You'll have to cut through
the thin lines that join your device to the outer rim.
To do this, go to the scribing station, and scratch
though the metal line (and substrate below).  The chrome
is so firmly attached that the substrate scratches
before the contact breaks reliably.   It is also possible
to scribe and break your sample into individual devices,
but this is not necessary and there is a chance it
could crack away from your scribe line and ruin your
device.

<B><CENTER><P>Indium Solder Station (Contacting your device)</B></CENTER>

<P>In principle, you can just take the probes from the
multimeter and push them against the contact pads to
make your measurements, but the probes have a tendency
to move around.  You'll probably get more reliable
contacts if you go to the soldering station and attach
small blobs of indium to the contact pads. This metal
is soft, so you can deform it and make good contact
to it with the probes afterwards.  Cut a piece of wire
about 1-2mm long using the razor blade, then use the
soldering iron to attach all or part of it to the contact.

<B><CENTER>4-Point Resistance Technique</B></CENTER>

 <P>The easiest thing to do to measure the resistance is
to hook it up to a multimeter and read off the value.
 The multimeter puts a voltage across the sample, measures
the current, and divides, to give you a value of resistance.
 This works in some situations, but is not always acceptable.
 Here's why:

<P>Consider a sample of chrome or silicon, which tend to
grow a thin layer of oxide (an insulator, or at least
a poor conductor) on the surface.  If we take the two
probes from the multimeter, we are measuring the sum
of three equivalent resistors - the interior of the
sample, plus the two contact resistances, as shown
below.<P>

What we really want to measure is the sample, not the
contacts, and to do this, we use a 4-point measurement,
as shown below.  How does this get around the problem?
 In the 2-point measurement, all the current that flows
through the sample also must flow through the contact
points, and we measure the sum of all the voltage drops.
 In the 4-point scheme, the current flows through one
set of leads, and we measure the voltage across the
other set of leads.  Since the voltmeter has in internal
resistance that is very high, essentially no current
flows through this loop.  Thus no current flows through
the contact resistances that the voltmeter measures
across, and the only voltage contribution is from the
current flowing through the sample itself.

<P>Note that if the contact resistances are very high,
unless we use a high voltage power supply, we will
get very small currents in the sample, and thus low
voltages (hard to measure!) across the sample resistance.

<B><CENTER><P>Thermoelectric Peltier Cooler</B></CENTER>

<P>A thermoelectric cooler is a solid state refrigerator.
 When current is forced through it in one direction
heat is pumped from the top stage to the lower heat
sink stage, thereby cooling the top stage.  When the
current is reversed, the top stage is heated.  The
physics is just the reverse of that in a thermocouple
junction; in both cases a wire is broken and another
wire made of a different metal or semiconductor is
spliced in, thereby creating two junctions.  In the
case of the thermocouple, a temperature difference
is applied between the two junctions, and a potential
difference results.  In the case of a Peltier cooler,
a potential difference is applied and a temperature
difference results.  Both make use of the fact that
the electrons (or "holes") which are conducting
heat are also those that conduct electricity,  so one
can affect the other.  There is an article on Thermoelectric
materials/devices in the most recent issue of Physics
Today, a magazine for professional physicists [G. Mahan,
B. Sales, and J. Sharp, Physics Today, <B>50</B>, 42, March
1977].

<P>*The Peltier cooler can be used to cool your device.
 Use some heat sink compound (grease) to stick your
device down to the upper plate, centering the part
you want to cool.  Connect the red lead to the positive
power supply and the black to the negative.  Do not
drive more than 1.5 amps of current through the cooler.
 It may take several minutes to obtain a temperature
change of about 20C.

<P>You can monitor the temperature of the stage with a
thermocouple junction, however during cool down the
stage will be significantly cooler than your device
because the thermal conductivity of the glass is poor.

<P>What happens when warm, moist air is in contact with
a cold object?  Some VCR players disable themselves
when you bring them in from the cold.  They flash a
3 letter word on the display.  The sensor that invokes
this condition looks much like the sensor you have
made.

<B><CENTER><P>Thermocouple Junction (temperature measurements)</B></CENTER>

<P>There are several ways to measure temperature that are
used routinely in laboratory experiments.  A simple
mercury or alcohol thermometer is one option, or a
bimetallic strip in a coil, like a typical dial thermometer.
 Each of these causes a visible indication of the volume
change the materials experience as their temperature
changes.  While these are reliable sensors, they require
an observer.  Temperature sensors that give out an
electrical signal related to their temperature allow
us the luxury of connecting another bit of electronics,
a chart recorder, to measure the temperature as a function
of time on a continuous basis.  Or, one can take the
electrical signal and feed it into the computer, and
get a plot of temperature vs. time, or measure other
signals and correlate the temperature change with some
other property.  The most common electrical temperature
sensors are thermocouples and thermistors.  Thermocouples
are passive devices that generate a voltage difference
when two metal junctions are held at different temperatures,
as shown in the figure below:

<P>A crude picture of the origin of this voltage is that
the electrons at the hot end of a metal move faster
than those in the cold end, and you can get a 'pileup'
of electrons at the cold end, making that end more
negative than the hot end.  The amount of electron
separation that develops depends on the material.
Since both ends of the voltmeter are at the same temperature,
we have to rely on a difference in voltage generated
by having two different metals in our sensor.  So the
voltage we measure will be a difference in the voltages
that each material tries to set up.   The second junction
is used to provide a reference temperature, and most
tables of thermocouple voltages (vs. T) use 0 degrees C for
the reference temperature.  If you skip the reference
junction, you will measure the voltage difference between
the probe and room temperature; you can use a thermometer
to determine room temperature, and add the equivalent
voltage to your reading to make it compare with the
chart.  Be sure that your temperatures are in the same
kinds of degrees as the chart!

<P>One of the most common combinations of metals used in
thermocouple junctions is Chromel and Alumel, a couple
of alloys.   The voltage values for this combination
are listed on the attached chart for a range of temperatures.
(Coincidentally, this is the combination we will use
in the lab.)  Note the units -- millivolts; you'll
need to think about that when you look at feeding that
signal into the multimeter.

<B><CENTER><P>Photodetector and Light Source</B></CENTER>

<P>We will also have available a white light source and
a photodetector that will give you a millivolt reading
as a function of the light that strikes it.  The detector
is rather sensitive, and will saturate if too much
light hits is, but is quite linear over a pretty good
range.  There will be a cardboard box to put around
the setup if you want to get rid of the effect of ambient
light.  Can you think of a way to use the light transmission
through two IMPS chips to measure something useful?
 *You can first experiment by just looking through
them as you put them into contact.

<B><CENTER><P>Salt Solution</B></CENTER>

<P>Some salt solutions will be available in dropper bottles.
 *How might contact with salt water change the properties
of your device?  Could you make something useful of
this effect?

<B><P>LAB WRITE-UP<BR>
DUE MONDAY, Mar. 10 at 5pm, IMPS room lab turn-in box</B>

<P>Here's an outline for the write-up. Each pair (assuming
you worked with someone) should produce one report,
describing both devices, and all experiments performed.
 Suggested length 6-8 pages.  TYPED.

<B><P>Abstract (&lt;100 words)</B><BR>
How the devices were made, what characterizations were
performed, one interesting result.

<B><P>Introduction</B><BR>
Brief background on  the processing techniques that
were used --i.e., how does electroplating work, what
is photoresist and how did it allow you to pattern
the films, etc. for each of the steps of the device
fab?  Theory behind operation of the device.

<B><P>Design decisions</B><BR>
This may not flush out to a full matrix(as described
in the first handout), but explain why you chose the
composition deposition time, the pattern, the characterization
technique you did (hopefully not all will be"TA
suggested it").  Report on whether these choices
panned out.

<B><P>Fabrication procedures and results</B><BR>
What you did in each of the first two labs, in a readable
format, and what results of the processing you observed.

<B><P>Testing procedures</B><BR>
Describe the equipment you used, results you obtained,
at least one experiment per person.  You don't have
to transcribe all the 'manuals' we gave you, but at
least make it clear how/why each piece of equipment
is used for each function (e.g. why used oscilloscope
for ac measurements, if you did).

<B><P>Summary/conclusion</B><BR>
Results of your characterization, design changes you'd
make if you had another go at it, etc.
