<h3>
These MicroRobots are one tenth the thickness of human hair, about as wide as a hair, and shorter than the sharp point of a thumb tack, yet they can be remotely controlled to navigate anywhere on a surface.  Integrated in this small package are a wireless power and control signal receiver, walking actuator, steering actuator, and on-board state memory.
</h3>
<p>
An interdiscplinary team of engineers and computer scientists at Dartmouth
have made the world's smallest untethered mobile robots.  These robots can
be remote controlled to walk anywhere on a special surface. The robots
move forward with an inch-worm like gait, bending one step at a time.  
They turn by snapping down a foot on the end of a steering arm; 
motion then pivots arount the fixed foot.   
An operator can control forward motion and turning with a sequence of 
commands through a wireless tramsmission that also powers the motion.
There is a <i>potential</i> for very precise position control; the average step 
size is a minute 12nm, about .01% of a hair diameter. However, 
the robots take over ten thousand steps a second and continue their motion
for over half an hour with no sign of fatigue, with net motion of
over one foot in length.  That represents over 30 million steps; 
a human taking that many steps would go over half way around the world.

These microrobots were all designed at Dartmouth using Thayer School tools and techniques, fabricated in part by a foundary service with all remaining fabrication, tuning, and operation in the Thayer School Microengineering Lab.  All videos of these microrobots have been recorded at Thayer School of Engineering.

are the insulated interdigitated electrode array which transmits power and control signals to the robot.

The underlying video of the robot motion is unedited except that it is shown twice actual speed.  The curved portion utilizes both turning and straight motion gaits.  The robot is 250 microns long and 10 microns high.

<b>The Dartmouth Research Team</b>
<br>
The work is fundamentally interdsicplinary, involving electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering, materials science, and computer science.  It is representative of the groundbreaking work that comes from Dartmouth College, where strong interactions between departments are encouraged, and Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, where there are no traditional departments to create  boundaries between electrical, mechanical, chemical, and other types of engineering.  
The research team includes:
<p>
<b>Students</b> (those who do the hard work):
<ul>
<li>
<b>Craig McGray</b>*: the Dartmouth graduate student who did most of the initial lab work in the 
<a href="https://microeng.engineering.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth Thayer Microengineering Laboratory</a> on the single untethered MEMS robots.  
[*now at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(<a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>) in Gaithersburg, Md.].
<li>
<b>Igor Paprotny*</b>: the Dartmouth graduate student extended this work
to interactions between robots, including assembly of multi-robot structures.[*now a professor at the University of Illinois-Chicago]
<li>
<b>Richard Rohl</b>*: a Dartmouth summer intern who designed a vacuum 
micro-probe to 
facilitate moving and testing of these robots on multiple surfaces [*work done
at Dartmouth Thayer School while on leave from Cornell University as part of
a NSF sponsored Research Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU program)].
<li>
<b>Shara Feld</b> and <b>Ellen Pettigrew</b>: Dartmouth undergraduates who have worked on larger (1mm) scale versions of these robots and related
devices.
</ul>
<b>Faculty</b>(alphabetical):
<ul>
<li>
<b>Prof. Bruce Donald*</b>  
<br>PI and lead on robotics, control, robot interaction, and security applications.  [*now at Duke University]: 
<li>
<b>Prof. Christopher Levey</b>, Director, Dartmouth Thayer Microengineering Lab: <br>Lead on electromechanical design, robot fabrication/processing, robot testing, and microscopy.
<li>
<b>Prof. Daniela Rus</b>*: 
<br>Lead on self-reconfigurable robotic applications [*now at MIT]:  
</ul>
