We are facing a problem when we try to polish a silicon wafer using a 
solution of HF:HNO3:CH3COOH. After the polish we rinse the wafer in DI water. 
Sometimes it happens that the wafer gets a sort of opaque layer that we don't 
manage to remove.
Does anyone know what might be the problem?
Thanks in advance

Your layer may be oxide coming from your DI water... So don't rinse your 
wafer with DI water, use 10% HF solution, your sample must be dry after 
removing from this solution...

Bye

Probably a sub-oxide of silicon. Is it reddish or brownish? It can be removed
by fully oxidizing it and then etching it with HF. The oxidation can be done
chemically or thermally.

The staining problem you are having is due to exposing the partially 
etched wafers to air for too long a time.  The stain can be brownish or 
whitish.  This can be avoided by quenching (diluting the etch before 
exposing the wafers to air) either very quickly with water or with conc. 
nitric acid or with acetic acid.  Nitric acid works best.  The water 
quench must be done quickly and you must use a volume of water equal to 
the amount of etch.  When quenching with acid, you must use about half 
the volume of acid as you have in the etch.

When you want to finish the etch, leave the wafers in the acid.  Then 
quickly pour the quenching liquid (water or acid) into the etch.  Then 
quickly remove the wafers and place them immediately into running d.i. 
water.

Of course, you must use all of the appropriate safety precautions when 
working with acids, etc.

If you do get a stain, it can usually be removed by boiling the wafers 
in water.  This oxidizes the stain on the surface of the wafer.

A thesis I read part of (forgot whose, but I might be able to find out)
used the HNA etch to remove p+ Si.  They reported a brown stain after
the etch, which they attributed to the presence of porous silicon.  To
remove the stain, they used 97:3 HNO3:HF (this is a Si etch) for 15 seconds.
FWIW, if your stain is, in fact, porous Si, the oxidation methods others
have mentioned should also work.

Good luck,
steve k
