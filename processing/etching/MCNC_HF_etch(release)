The oxide release layer is PSG not LTO.  PSG etches considerably faster
than LTO in concentrated HF.  I have some data that suggests the
lateral etch rate (under structures) is as fast as 15-20 um/min.  the
2.5 minutes is a conservative release time.  You may be able to do it
in as little as 60 sec.  I've had pretty repeatable results releasing
for 90 seconds.  But, with the gold metallurgy we are using now, there
is no reason to hurry the release.  I would stick with 2.5 minutes.
