Chris,

  In the initial processing, Todd mixed up a 13:2:1:1 solution of
Phos/Nitric/Acetic/DI, for a 0.5 $B5m thick nickel film it took approximately
5 miuntes.

  I used a Aluminum etch ( I really don't know why I changed) of 3:3:1:1, and
it took 15 minutes to etch a 0.5$B5m nickel film.

  I assume that the Phosphoric is what attacks the Nickel most readily, so
using a mixture of 16:1:1:2 at 70deg.C should etch pretty quick.
