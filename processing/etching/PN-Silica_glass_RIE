Do you know the RIE etch rate in BK7 glass, and do you know the etch ratio

  As I remember, the etch rate of glass under my RIE machien is on the order
of ~50 to 100A per minute.
   If you can live with quartz wafers. Etch rate for quartz wafer is much
higher than glass. Probably in the range 1000A per minute or more.
       If you want to etch quartz for about  1 micron thick, you can use
phoresist as mask.
	If the glass is not pure SiO2, forget about etch glass in plasma mode.  I
tried this about two years ago and find out from other papers and my own
experience that the etch rate is very slow because of the high impurity
nature of glass.
