Abstract     Solutions based on ammonium hydroxide and water were
             investigated for anisotropic etching of monocrystalline
             silicon. In 2.65 M NH/sub 3/ solutions at 80 degrees C, the
             addition of H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ in a concentration between 0.
             65*10/sup -2/ M and 1.84*10/sup -2/ M increases the silicon
             etch rate in the (100) direction to 75 mu m/h, which is a
             factor of about 2.5 higher compared to pure etchants. In
             addition, when the pH value was adjusted above 11.3, silicon
             etching proceeds in H/sub 2/O/sub 2/-doped solutions without
             formation of pyramidal-shaped hillocks. The influence of the
             pH value and H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ concentration on the etching
             behaviour is discussed in detail. Passivation layers, like
             silicon oxides and silicon nitrides formed under various
             preparation conditions, and metals show excellent stability in
             AHW solutions. The temperature dependence of etch rates as
             well as the influence of post-treatments on the etching
             behaviour is discussed

Abstract     Wet chemical etchants based on ammonium hydroxide-water (AHW)
             solutions for micromachining monocrystalline silicon are
             described. The etchants can be applied under clean-room
             conditions within standard IC fabrication lines. The nature of
             AHW solutions is discussed with respect to anisotropy and
             selectivity. At 75 degrees C and 9 wt.% AHW, a maximum etch
             Si/sub 3/N/sub 4/ and highly boron-doped silicon. Aluminium
             will not be attacked by silicon-doped AHW etchants. Therefore,
             standard IC metallization techniques can be used for device
             fabrication. The application of AHW solutions to the
             fabrication of basic micromechanical structures is demonstrated
