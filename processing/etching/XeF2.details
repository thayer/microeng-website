Since my first XeF2 post last month, I have had many inquiries about
this silicon etchant.  Many of the same questions have been asked
several times, so it seems appropriate that I should summarize here.

ksjp

** How did you find XeF2 in the first place?
 While discussing TMAH+silicic acid as a possible CMOS post-process
etchant, a colleague of mine, Eli Yablonovitch, suggested that XeF2
might be just the thing we were looking for.  We spent several days
calling chemical supply and excimer laser companies, all of whom
denied that XeF2 could exist, and we ultimately gave up.  Several weeks
later, in a discussion on polysilicon stringer etching, Mike Hecht of
JPL mentioned that he had used XeF2 to etch 300 microns of silicon
and stop on 50 Angstroms of SiO2, and that XeF2 could be purchased
from PCR (see below).  Mike reassembled his old reactor at JPL, and we
etched the first CMOS chip together at UCLA.

** it sublimates [...] is the gas fed into an evacuated chamber?
Yes, we have a small glass bell jar on an aluminum plate with ports
for N2, a vacuum pump, manometer, and the XeF2 line.  For reasons that
are as yet unclear, we get the best performance when we pulse etch
(pump/etch/pump) rather than allow a constant flow of gas into the
chamber.

** What does it etch?  Not etch?
Etches silicon and polysilicon at up to 10 microns per minute.
Does not etch (at all, as far as we can tell):
  photoresist
  thermal oxide, PSG, BPSG
  aluminum
  gold
  NiTi (supplied courtesy TiNi Alloy Co.)
  Si3N4 (haven't tested low stress yet)
  acrylic

** It sounds like this is a 'dry' etch
Yes, and an extremely gentle one.  We have undercut some structures
that are so fragile they can be destroyed by blowing on the chip,
but which survive the etch.  No liquid or adhesion forces.

** Are there any tricks?
Dehydrate your sample (e.g. 140C for 10 minutes) before etching,
otherwise you may have problems with the formation of a polymer-like
film on the silicon surface.  Neil Bartlett (discoverer of the first
noble gas compound in 1962) thinks that this film is probably the
silicon equivalent of PTFE.

** How much anisotropy, if any, can you achieve?
Close to none.  The etch is nearly isotropic.

** How smooth are the sidewalls and bottom surfaces
Very rough.  All surfaces show something like 1-2 microns roughness.

** Is it safe?
On contact with moisture, it turns to xenon and HF, but at the room
temperature sublimation rate, this produces a hazard comparable to
an open beaker of HF - caution is necessary.

** Where can I buy it and how much does it cost?
PCR Inc
P.O. Box 1466
Gainsville, FL 32602
(904) 376-8246
      371-6246 (fax)
The cost is $45/gm, which may seem expensive, but the etch is
extremely efficient, and one gram of XeF2 can last for many etches.
Also, the cost goes down rapidly with larger orders to a few dollars
per gram.

** What are some of the references?

   Al/SiO2 interface", J. Appl. Phys, 57(12), 1985, pp5256-5261.

   standard CMOS", MEMS 95, pp.288-293.

** Can you send me some papers on this?
We can send you our MEMS 95 paper, which doesn't give much detail about
XeF2, but does describe our etch setup and procedure.  Send me email
if you want a copy.
