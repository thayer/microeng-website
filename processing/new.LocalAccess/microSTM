Dear Steve,

In answer to your question: Can someone tell me what the breakthrough is?

Yes I can, but the press release you read does not convey the information.
The breakthrough is that we have fabricated an integrated, micro-STM with an
xyz actuator and integrated tip and we demonstrated that it can function as a
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) (Yang Xu, Scott A. Miller, and Noel C.
MacDonald, "Microelectromechanical Scanning Tunneling Microscope," American
Physical Society March Meeting, San Jose, CA, Mar. 20-24, 1995.  Bulletion of
the American Physical Society , vol 40, No. 1, p. 63).  Further we have reduced
the size of the STM to about 200 micrometers on-a-side with xyz actuators and
tip (s); we now have a fully integrated, very high tip density silicon process
(K.A. Shaw, et al., Sensors and Actuators A 40, 63 (1994))and(Z. L. Zhang and
N. C. MacDonald, J. Micromech. Microeng. 2, 31 (1992)) to make arrays of
MICROSTMs and MICROAFMs. Most important we have a process technology that now
works for this application. Also, the technology can scale to 100,000's of tips
and some architectures provide very fast read out of the data, but this
information is not part of the statement you read.  Again our contribution is
the development of integrated xyz microactuators with integrated tips in
silicon technology.  Furthermore the technology can be scaled to massively
parallel probe architectures.

Our STM is small enough to be an array element for a massively parallel
STM/AFM architecture (again that's the point) -including an 'on-chip',
integrated z position microsensor for AFM (no external light source or mirror
is required)- and is compatible with silicon processing techniques.
Furthermore, each xyz actuator can support many tips (maybe up to 100) - not
just one tip per actuator - see for example a 25 tip array on one XYZ actuator
([1] Z. Lisa Zhang and N. C. MacDonald, "Integrated Silicon Process for
Micro-Dynamic Vacuum Field Emission Cathodes,"  J. Vac. Sci. Technol.,Vol. B
11(6), pp. 2538-2543, (Nov/Dec. 1993). [2] Z. L. Zhang and N. C. MacDonald, J.
Micromech. Microeng. 2, 31 (1992)).  As is pointed out in "Technology of
Proximal Probe Lithography" by Christie Marrian (ed.), SPIE IS10,1993, page 7
and page 30, the only practical way to use proximal probes in lithography and
data storage is to operate arrays of tips in parallel. The point is we have
realized a single crystal silicon process with integrated tips, xyz actuators
and electrical contacts on moving structures.  This is the paradigm we have
been working on for 8 or 9 years.  Fast, highly integrated xyz microactuators
with integrated tips is the game -no assembly and integrated transistors on the
moving structure (J. J. Yao et al., Sensors and Actuators A 40, 77 (1994)) for
addressing!  Silicon is a great choice for such a device or array of devices
for massively parallel information storage or massively parallel lithography
etc.

We have demonstrated tip-arrays with 5 micrometer spacing using the
same process used to make the working microSTM ([1]  J. P. Spallas and N. C.
MacDonald, "Self-aligned Silicon Field Emission Cathode Arrays formed by
selective, lateral thermal oxidation of silicon,"  J. Vac. Sci. Technol., Vol.
B 11 (2), pp. 437-440, (Mar./Apr. 1993). [2]  S. Arney and N. C. MacDonald,
"Formation of Submicron Silicon on Insulator Structures by Lateral Oxidation of
Substrate-Silicon Islands", J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B:6 (1), 341-345, (Jan/Feb
1988).).  Furthermore, with the same technology tips or
small arrays of tips can be spaced 25-50 micrometers apart and integrated with
individual z micro-actuators; so one xy manipulator can support many tips but
each tip would have a seperate z actuator.  Contacts, isolation, interconnects,
and transistors (for amplifiers) have been fabricated on moving single
crystal silicon beams  with our silicon MEMS technology  (Z. L. Zhang and N. C.
MacDonald, J. Vac. Sci. Technol. B 11, 2538 (1993))  Yes, we need all the
pieces  to produce massively parallel tip-array architecture's and now we have
them - refer to the publications etc..  Here we finally demonstrated an image
with our microSTM to show that all the integrated pieces work.

It's an all or nothing technology for massively parallel scan-probe array
architecture's! You must have all the pieces.  In addition, we have
demonstrated a very sensitive' integrated  Single Crystal Silicon torsional
cantilever technology (both STMs incorporate this z actuator) which is useful
for array architecture's.  So the 'big deal' is the integrated micro STM works;
it is made using a robust single crystal silicon MEMS process;  one xy(z)
actuactor can support many tips using our process depending on the
architecture; it is a highly integrated, batch fabricated technology;  and all
the pieces have now been demonstrated. Other questions (you could ask) are can
we make these suspended silicon structures over an area a few mms on-a-side,
and can we make actuators that move 50 or so micrometers per tip? Fortunately
the answer is now yes to both questions. We have recently demonstrated a
suspended large area actuator (4mm x 5mm) that produces 10 milliNewtons of
force using the same technology used to make the microSTM (M. T. A. Saif and
N. C. MacDonald, [1]"Design Considerations for Large  MEMS," Proceedings  paper
2448-10; 1995  North American Conference on Smart Structures and Materials, San
Diego, Ca., 26 February - 3 March 1995;  M. T. A Saif and N. C. MacDonald. [2]
`A Milli-Newton Micro-Loading Device" accepted for Transducers '95, June 25-29,
Stockholm, Sweden, June 25 - 29, 1995.); so things are finally looking positive
for making large arrays of tips that move in xyz over a 50 micrometer x 50
micrometer area per tip and cover a total area (with all the tips) of at least
5 mm x 5mm - all the tips and microactuators are mounted on a large, suspended
and planar single crystal silicon structure.

Steve, Give me a call if you need additional information or discussion.
