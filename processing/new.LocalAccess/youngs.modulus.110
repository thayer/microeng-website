Silicon is a cubic crystal; as such a measure such as "Young's modulus"
is insufficient to describe its anisotropic behavior.  In terms of
modeling, one should use an anisotropic elastic description for the
material either in the crystal axes ([100],[010],[001] directions as
base directions for the elastic constants) or in axes which may be
more natural for the problem you are looking at.  In your case, you
are dealing with {110} wafers, which would make the [110], [1,-1,0] and
[001] crystal directions more natural, perhaps.  Note that in this
case, you will have the "x_1" direction normal to the wafer, and "x_2 &
x_3" will lie in the plane of the wafer.  In this orientation, the
material appears orthotropic rather than cubic, so it requires a few
more constants to characterize.  In either case, the elastic constants
are well known.

If you choose to use the cubic crystal axes ([100], [010], [001]), the 
6x6 stiffness tensor is (in units of GPa),

	[  166   64   64   0    0    0  ]
	[   64  166   64   0    0    0  ]
	[   64   64  166   0    0    0  ]
C_ij =  [    0    0    0  80    0    0  ]
	[    0    0    0   0   80    0  ]
 	[    0    0    0   0    0   80  ]

(In other words, C_11 = 166 GPa, C_12 = 64 GPa, C_66 = 80 GPa.)


If you choose to use the rotated axes ([110], etc.), the stiffness tensor
is

	[  194   35   64   0    0    0  ]
	[   35  194   64   0    0    0  ]
	[   64   64  166   0    0    0  ]
C_ij =  [    0    0    0  80    0    0  ]
	[    0    0    0   0   80    0  ]
 	[    0    0    0   0    0   51  ]


The recent dissertation by Peter Krulevitch (1994, Mechanical Engineering, U.C.
Berkeley) discusses the issues of material modeling for various problems.
It may be of some help in sorting this out.

I hope this helps!
