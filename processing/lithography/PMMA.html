2.7.2.1 PMMA
<p>
Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was one of the first materials developed for e-beam
lithography.[133-134] It is the standard positive e-beam resist and remains one of the highest
resolution resists available. PMMA is usually purchased[135] in two high molecular weight
forms (496 K or 950 K) in a casting solvent such as chlorobenzene or anisole. PMMA is spun
onto the substrate and baked at 170C to 200C for 1 to 2 hours. Electron beam exposure breaks
the polymer into fragments that are dissolved preferentially by a developer such as MIBK. MIBK
alone is too strong a developer and removes some of the unexposed resist. Therefore, the
developer is usually diluted by mixing in a weaker developer such as IPA. A mixture of 1 part
MIBK to 3 parts IPA produces very high contrast [136] but low sensitivity. By making the
developer stronger, say, 1:1 MIBK:IPA, the sensitivity is improved significantly with only a
small loss of contrast.
<p>
The sensitivity of PMMA also scales roughly with electron acceleration voltage, with the critical
dose at 50 kV being roughly twice that of exposures at 25 kV. Fortunately, electron guns are
proportionally brighter at higher energies, providing twice the current in the same spot size at 50
kV. When using 50 kV electrons and 1:3 MIBK:IPA developer, the critical dose is around 350
uC/cm2. Most positive resists will show a bias of 20 to 150 nm (i.e. a hole in the resist will be
larger than the electron beam size), depending on the resist type, thickness, and contrast and
development conditions and beam voltage.
<p>
When exposed to more than 10 times the optimal positive dose, PMMA will crosslink, forming a
negative resist. It is simple to see this effect after having exposed one spot for an extended time
(for instance, when focusing on a mark). The center of the spot will be crosslinked, leaving
resist on the substrate, while the surrounding area is exposed positively and is washed away. In
its positive mode, PMMA has an intrinsic resolution of less than 10 nm. [137] In negative mode,
the resolution is at least 50 nm. By exposing PMMA (or any resist) on a thin membrane, the
exposure due to secondary electrons can be greatly reduced and the process latitude thereby
increased. PMMA has poor resistance to plasma etching, compared to novolac-based
photoresists. Nevertheless, it has been used successfully as a mask for the etching of silicon
nitride [138] and silicon dioxide, [139] with 1:1 etch selectivity. PMMA also makes a very
effective mask for chemically assisted ion beam etching of GaAs and AlGaAs. [140]

EXAMPLE PROCESS: PMMA POSITIVE EXPOSURE AND LIFTOFF

          1.Start with 496K PMMA, 4% solids in chlorobenzene. Pour resist onto a Si
            wafer and spin at 2500 rpm for 40 to 60 seconds.
          2.Bake in an oven or on a hotplate at 180 C for 1 h. Thickness after baking: 300
            nm.
          3.Expose in e-beam system at 50 kV, with doses between 300 and 500 uC/cm2.
            (Other accelerating voltages may be used. The dose scales roughly with the
            voltage.)
          4.Develop for 1 min in 1:3 MIBK:IPA. Rinse in IPA. Blow dry with nitrogen.
          5.Optional descum in a barrel etcher: 150W, 0.6 Torr O2.
          6.Mount in evaporator and pump down to 210-6 Torr.
          7.Evaporate 10 nm Cr, then 100 nm Au.
          8.Remove from evaporator, soak sample in methelyne chloride for ~10 min.

Agitate substrate and methylene chloride with an ultrasonic cleaner for ~1 min to complete the
liftoff. Rinse in IPA. Blow dry. [141]
