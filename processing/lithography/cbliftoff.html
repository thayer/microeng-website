WE did have a problem with some rips in the photoresist both
near and well away from features, but I'm not sure of the
polish on the substrates (glass) the student was using.

Your exposure time is much longer than I'd have expected.
Even at 120C bake (that makes the resist much less sensitive and
requires longer exposures), we usually use more like 6 seconds.
What happens with the profile for shorter times?

We did the soak in the spinner (vented), but I'm not completely
happy with that either; would rather standardize on using the hood,
perhaps with the hood light off.

Did you also find a working recipe for toluene?

I purposely used a longer exposure to improve the undercut.  My goal was to
have the mask reproduced in the CB soaked layer.  Shorter exposures resulted in
less undercut (wider base, with about same overhang layer width).

I would not know what to expect when applying this CB soak recipe to a glass
substrate.  Any one or all of the paramters might need to be re-optimized.

Is it possible to get a small fume removal hood in the room next to or over the
spinner so that we can do CB soaks and such there?

I gave up on the tolulene soak, I did not have the time to pursue it at the
time.

Sometime soon I will be over to make some more devices.  Then, we will know for
sure how robust a recipe I came up with.

Chris,

I finally used the following:

dehydration bake, 120 'C, > 2min
spin on HMDS
spin on 1813; ~800 rpm, 5 sec then 4000 rpm, 1min
bake; 90 'C, 1 min.
8 sec exposure   <-----------
5 min soak in chlorobenzene  <----------
blow dry
45-50 sec. puddle dev. MF 319  <-----------
rinse, DI-H2O
Blow dry
metaliztion
liftoff in acetone  <---------

The lift-off was VERY easy.  I used the ultrasound but it was not necessary.
Acetone  squirted from a syringe would have worked well too.

I've attached a picture I took of the trial run using these parameters.  As you
can see, the pedistal base walls are not vertical but there is a fair amount of
overhang.

I was thinking that a longer soak in the CB (~10 min.) would make the overhang
stronger and allow a longer develop time and a longer exposure which could
facilitate getting the vertical pedistal walls I'd perfer to have.

CHris,

What were your optimum conditions you found for liftoff?
s1813 photoresist
8s exposure
5min soak in toluene (more?)
60s develop?
liftoff in acetone or act?  ultrasonic?
