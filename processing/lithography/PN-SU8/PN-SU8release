Dear Peng Jin,


I am replying to your question concerning your desire to work with a
negative resist that can easily be removed in a standard photoresist
stripper....My company, MicroChem Corp, manufactures a negative tone
photoresist called SU-8 which is widely used in the MEMS area but up
till now has had some issues related to the stripping, especially after
electroplating....We have recently developed a release layer that is
spin coated onto the seed layer/substrate and baked, then the SU-8 is
applied and processed as per normal...A very short development step is
then performed to develop out the release layer, in either O2 Plasma or
an aqueous developer such as Shipley MF319....The electroplating step
can then be performed followed by immersion in either a developing
solution (MF319) or a NMP based stripper such as Remover PG or Shipley's
1165 Remover which dissolves the release layer, leaving behind the
electroplated feature....

If you have any further questions or if you need additional information
including a sample please contact me at 617-965-5511 ext. 308 or via
email at mshaw@microchem.com

Thanks and best regards,

Mark Shaw

Hi, friends,

In my research project, I need to find a kind of negative photoresist
which
must be easy to remove by acetone or other chemical solvent. Could
anyone give
me some idea about it?

Thanks.

Peng Jin

Reply-To: mems-talk@memsnet.org

Hello All,

When metals are heated up, some change from solid to liquid then to
vapor
(for example, Au, Al, Ni...), and some change form solid to vapor
directly
(Cr).  I am wondering where I can find a list of such information for
commonly used metals.  Thanks a lot.

Yahong

Hi Nathalia,

Thank you for your kind email. I have sent a message to durafilm to see
if they can supply me with the foil I need.

Regards,
Heiko van der Linden

Hi Heiko,

depending on the teflon you're looking for, Durafilm might have it.
Write me an email if you need more info/their webpage.
(nathalia@sensors.stanford.edu).

Dear MEMS-members,

Does anyone know what company can manufacture an etching tank with the
circulated oil bath that can keep the solution temperature constant?
Thanks!

Reply-To: mems-talk@memsnet.org

Dear all,

I readed some papers about sensor interface circuits, and found
that EEPROM is widely used in them. Could you recommand some
papers and books, which state the EEPROM's function in sensor
interface circuits in depth?

Thanks in advace,

Sincerely,

Li Gang

Hi Peng,
The best is BCB by DowCorning.
I also know PDMS by Wackerchemie or Gelest but it's quite difficult to
obtain.
