<p>
<LI>Dry the substrate:
<P>&#149; 3-5 minutes at 120C on hotplate (or 30 minutes in 120C oven)</P>
<P>&#149; OPTIONAL:  for oxides, pipette on a small amount of HMDS (just enough to cover wafer), puddle 5 seconds, then spin (5s@900RPM, 60S@4000RPM, check vacuum before spinning)</P>

Spin</a> on photoresist:
<ul>
<li> Center sample on spinner and check vacuum.</P>
<li> 5 seconds at 900 RPM (this clears excess resist to avoid splash-back)</P>
<li> 60 seconds at 4000 RPM (1.3 micron film)</P>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Softbake the resist:</P>
<ul>
<li>3 minutes on hotplate at 100C (or  30 minutes in the 100 C oven)  Note:  alternative softbake at 90C will increase resist sensitivity, requiring  shorter exposure times.
</ul>

<P><li>Align and expose using

This dose, ~140 mJ/cm all lines </FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>2</FONT><FONT FACE="Times"> may need to be optimized for your substrate (e.g. up to 3* that  dose is required over Cu).
S1813 datasheet shows 82mJ/cm2 at 435nm as threshold for complete exposure (somewhat less sensitivity to shorter wavelengths included in our source).

<P><li>  Develop:
<ul>
<li>Puddle MF319 developer for 60 seconds (pattern usually shows in 5  seconds)</P>
<li>Spin rinse with DI water 35 seconds at about 300 RPM</P>
<li>Spin dry 60 seconds at 3000-4000 RPM, with a burst of nitrogen gas in the center of the sample.
</ul>
