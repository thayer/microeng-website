Dear Sonia,
if you still have the problem of rough gold plating you may need to
re-evaluate your plating process.  The quality of your plating including
roughness, uniformity, purity, density, electrical properties etc, depends
in general on a number of parameters. To mention a few, not necesarily in
order of importance:
1. plating temperature
2. current density (usually expressed in mA/cm2 or A/dm2 or A/ft2 and
refering   to the area of MEMS patterns on the wafer to be electroplated)
3. current mode (DC, pulse, reverse pulse etc.)
4. electroplating solution composition, additives and quality of maintenance
5. cell/equipment design (anode geometry, anode position, tank shape etc.)
6. mixing/stirring conditions
7. quality of the seed layer 
8. quality of the adhesion layer
9. quality of photoresist material
10. quality of imaging
11. pre-plating steps, cleaning, rinsing etc.
12. MEMS design, geometry,  etc. 

Your rough finish may be there for a number of reasons.  Most probably your
current density was OK, since you wanted to grow (I suppose, advised by the
supplier) 2 microns/20 min, corresponding to 1.5- 2.0 mA/cm2 (most Golds are
in the range of 1-10 mA/cm2). If your mixing was reasonable and you have an
adequate plating cell and, your photoresist is adequately processed and, the
pattern is a simple step-and-repeat pattern with small aspect ratio or there
is no pattern at all and, you have properly cleaned and rinsed your wafer
and, the roughness is uniform across the wafer, you probably have the
problem with either solution maintenance (you should establish solution
quality with the Hull Cell, a simple test to determine solution quality and
performance prior to electroplating of the wafer; suppliers sometimes
provide the service and help re-establish the solution), or the specific
solution you use to perform the plating actually delivers that finish at 2
micron thickness (how rough is rough, RMS?)or, the seed layer and/or
adhesion layer are inadequate. If your contact with solution supplier for
advice as already suggested by others (Stonas, Berg, Desta, e-mails) did not
produce a satisfactory result I suggest that you take care/verify  the above
parameters. I hope this helps. Good luck!
Sincerely,
Igor Kadija
