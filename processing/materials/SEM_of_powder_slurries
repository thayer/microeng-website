Dear Robin,
        I have just started to look at clay mineral particles on the HVEM, a
TEM rather than an SEM.  The colleague investigating clay from the bottom of
the Hudson river collects a sample of the sediment, washes it and settles it.
During the settling, she collects fractions at various times; these are
label-
led for their nominal sizes--  >5mu, 2mu, <2mu and <<2mu.  I had difficulties
getting good dispersal on a carbon-coated mesh grid at first, but I found
that
if I put a drop of poly-l-lysine on the grid and let it dry, I could then
agi-
tate the suspension of clay particles and put a 5 mu-liter drop on the grid.
This gave me very good dispersion of both the largest and the smallest parti-
cles.  I must emphasize that this is my first venture with anything like
this,
so listen to the real experts if any respond.  (I forgot to say that the 5
mu-
liter drop I put on the grid was just air dried.)  I am aware that clay mine-
rals' structures change when they dry, but we wanted to try the simplest
thing
first.  Good luck.
                                Yours,
                                Bill Tivol

I usually use the following technique for preparing powder samples for TEM. 
It could however be used also for SEM preparation. 

1. Put the powder sample in a small becher with ethanol, in rather high 
concentration. 

2. prepare another small becher (20 cc) filled with clean distilled water, 
nearly overful. You should get the feeling that adding one more drop of 
water would get it overflow... The best is to have a cylindrical becher, 
without the pouring part.

3. manage in order to have the reflexion of a white fluorescent tube light 
on the surface of the water. This will help you later in seeing where the 
particles are on the surface of the water.

4. drop one tiny drop of your ethanol suspension on the water. The drop 
will expand on the water surface, and you will get a film of sample on the 
surface.

5. Have a TEM grid with carbon film prepared, take it with tweezers, get it 
touch the water surface, wher the sample is (here you need a good eye, and 
the fluorescent tube dicussed above). When removing the grid, orient it at 
45 degrees, so that only a small drop of water gets stuck to it, on one 
edge. allow then this drop of water to touch a filter paper. The water will 
be thus removed instantaneously, and nearly no further drying will be be 
necessary. Hence pollution problems will be avoided. The sample particles 
stuck on the film won't get away with the water. 


Note. 

Instead of the becher filled with ethanol, you may as well use an 
agata mortar. About the dispersion of particles, it might however be 
possible that it is changed depending on the solution. Surely water and 
ethanol do not behave the same way.

If you have any further question, do not hesitate to get in touch with me 
directly.

Hi Robin,

You should contact John Mansfield at Michigan.  They have an Electroscan 
SEM that will allow you to look at the powders while in the aquaeous 
solution.  I'm sure that he can set you straight on whether this might 
be an appopriate application.

For drying, you might want to talk to some of the biological people 
there.  If the problem is with surface tension bring the particles 
together when they dry,  contact John Panitz at the Univ. of New Mexico.  
He has been licking the surface tension problem of putting biological 
molecules on the surfaces of metal tips for a number of years.  He uses 
a fast freezing mechnaism that he designed for doing this.  He presented 
a talk in New Orleans at MSA.

I have also been doing some microtoming of powders for use as EDS 
standards.  I tried using G1 epoxy (Epoxy Technology EpoTek 353ND) and 
doing it by routine dimpling and ion milling, but there was quite a bit 
of porosity in the epoxy after setting.  There is a guy here that has 
done coated SiC fibers encapsulated in epoxy (G1) and used the tripod 
polisher.  He has gotten some good results after ion milling at low 
angles.  (You can get a special stub for the Duomill for low angle 
milling.)  To use at 200 kV, I have to put a thin coat of carbon on the 
microtomed samples, but it doesn't seem to affect my k-factors.  Of 
course if you are after the oxygen or other light elements, this would 
be a problem for you.  At 100 kV, the resin used for microtoming is a 
lot more stable and you don't have to coat with carbon.

Also, in the three MRS "How to" books on TEM sample preparation, there 
are several methods presented for powders.

Call me if you have questions.

Regards,

Scott

Help!

We would like to characterize ceramic powders that are in an aqueous 
solution.   We need to know if the powders are individual powders or 
agglomerates.  Does anyone have any suggestion on SEM sample prep?   Is 
there a drying technique that leaves the particles well dispersed?

Also, what is the typical TEM sample prep techniques used for ceramic 
powders?

In response to R. Griffin's inquiry about sample prep for powders:

A powder in aqueous solution can be added dropwise to a culture tube
containing methanol.  The culture tube is in a rack inside an ultra-
sonic bath to disperse the particles.  After a minute or two, the 
solution can be dropped on to an SEM stub or a TEM grid using an
eye dropper or capillary tube open at both ends.  I like to use a
polished SEM stub because it has a smooth surface and makes it
easier to see the particles.  If you are using a TEM grid, place
the grid on top of 2 sheets of lens tissue before dropping the 
dispersion on to the grid; this will quickly wick away the 
solvent and keep the particles reasonably dispersed.

You can try other solvents (like hexane) but they may not be
compatible with water (the particles tend to flocculate).
Methanol or Ethanol usually work better in an aqueous solution.

The main idea is to disperse the partcles ultrasonically, then
use a volatile solvent which will evaporate quickly before the
particles have a chance to re-agglomerate.

        We quite frequently have to do SEM of many different kinds of 
powders.  The problem with putting a drop of suspended particles on a stub 
is that surface tension draws the particles into clumps as the liquid 
dries.  This is the technique that I use:
        1.  Make a very dilute suspension of the particles in methanol.
            You may have to determine the concentration by trial and error
            but it is very low.
        2.  Set up a vacuum filtration system using 10mm dia. Nuclepore
            filter membranes.  I use filters with a pore size of 0.1um.
        3.  Vacuum filter a few drops of the suspension through the 
            membrane.
        4.  Mount the filter on a stub and coat.
        
        By vacuum filtering, the liquid leaves the particles almost 
immediately so that surface tension doesn't have a chance to form 
clumps.  Nuclepore is the best filter to use because it is a sieve with 
small holes on a flat background which makes it easier to see the particles.
