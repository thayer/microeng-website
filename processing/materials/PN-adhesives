There are actually a wide variety of materials that could be used for this
process, depending on the process you wish to use to apply the material.
Off of the top of my head, I can think of three basic types:

1. Thermoplastic film:  This would be a film that would be applied through
application of heat and pressure.  Various materials are WaferGrip (wax,
heat release - Dynatex), StayStik (general adhesive, high temp, solvent
release - Cookson), Ablestik (general adhesive, low temp, solvent release).

2. Thermoplastic spin on material:  This is a material that would be spun on
using a resist coater (in some cases, requiring modification).  Various
materials: photoresist, GenTak (general adhesive, various grades, solvent
release - General Chemical), Staystick - paste form (see above)

3. Dry Film Materials - This would be a film that is applied via a tape roll
(either manually, or by a taping machine).  Only one comes to mind at the
moment:  Revalpha (Nitto Denko). This is effectively a tape with adhesive
material on both sides.  However, this is a thermal release film, meaning
that, when a certain threshold temperature is reached (depending on grade),
one side of the adhesive will undergo a chemical reaction that will cause
the material to become gaseous, allowing a total release of the substrate.
This may be the best case for thin substrates, as there will be little to no
"peeling" force required to remove the substrate.

Hi Everybody,
I am trying to bond some pre-thinned wafers (200um
thick) with LPCVD nitride on it (1000A) - to a normal
wafer substrate(500um ) thick.I need a temporary
bonding adhesive which I should be able to remove
after I have done some etching/lithography steps on
the pre-thinned wafers.

Does anybody know of commercially available adhesives
that I can use for this? I need an adhesive which is
very  simple in it's application and ideally would
like something which I can just apply in-between the
two wafers and then stick them together and later
should be able to de-bond them easily too.

Kaustubh Bhate.
