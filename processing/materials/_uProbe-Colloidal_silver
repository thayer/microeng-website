Leon Smuts,
 I've found that silver paints and pastes *seem* to dry quickly, but
actually degass for several hours, or a day or two, even using a vacuum
dessicator.
 I've also found some brands of carbon paint that are contaminated with
phosphorus. Don't recall which, off the top of my head, and the
formulation have been changed, but it's something that should be
checked, especially if you're doing EDX or WDX.
