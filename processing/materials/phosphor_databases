Jonathan,
Back when the world was young, and the US made a lot of CRTs all CRT
phosphors were registered with the EIA in the JEDEC series.  
The JEDEC manual was what assigned the numbers P40, P26, etc.  I
have just looked through my EIA catalog, and can't find it, so 
it might be rescinded (people stopped registering their phosphors).
Rescinded documents are still avialable, or may be in your library.
Unfortunately I haven't been able to find my JEDEC phosphor manual
for a couple of years, and don't recall the number.  The phone number
for EIA is 202-457-4004.
