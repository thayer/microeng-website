5/4 Au/i
about 6000A total.
AU etched in about 10 seconds, but left a brown film.
Au started to peel on rinse.
13%BHF didn't seem to take off the brown film.  Back into
AU etch; that didn't either, but it peeled more.


Neg photoresist for wells.
Spin 900rmp 4 s, 4000rpm 60s
bake 90C 15 min
expose 1s.
develop puddle 1min
rinse n butyl acetate slowly dispense 15s.
lots of spots in regions.  Should rinse longer, or perhaps spin slowly
 8 lines more (79%). Press <space> for more, 'i' to return.

with some dev first.


5/4 Say want .2mg.  2g/cm^2. =E-4cm^3  area=5x5mm = .250cm^2 .5E-3cm deep
--> 1.24E-4cm^3.  5microns deep minimum.

try 15 min in 13%BHF (based on .18micron/min in 5%) for 7 microns deep.
looked ok after 10 min, but photoresist peeled after 15 min.
Nevertheless grooves look ok.

Strip with microstrip at 100C. (ACT did not work)

5/11/99 
4 cover slips
2 min Ti deposition at 130W DC after 1.0 E-5 torr
positive PR. 4 sec exp[osure, 1 min develop
sample 1 photoresist uneven spin due to holder and applying while spinning; need
ed two minutes to develope around edges
samples 2-4 normal.
B sss
A
10s etch clears 5%HFin DI (BHF doesn't seem to work--2min in 12%BHF and no etch)
Etch for 20s.
Sample 2 PR was on backside.

Pos photoresist
4000rpm spin.
85C bake oven 5 minutes
1s exposur
1min dev (slow wash one full pipette)
45s rinse first in dev, then mix, then butyl acetate, spin 300rpm
bake hotplate 140C

HF etch one at 8 min, 2 at 12 min 12%BHF.
All seem to have lost PR early. puzzle.
ONe left--bake again at 145 for 4 minutes.
WIll try again withy NEW BHF.

5/3/99 Etch on 2" glass disk for wells: 15min 13% BHF.
got 8.5 microns deep wells.
