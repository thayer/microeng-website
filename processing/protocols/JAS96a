MOST RECENT AT BOTTOM:

Si wafers w/ 650A Ti sputtered.
Observe wafer pieces:  lots of Si particles from scratching numbers.
Some fiber and other particles.
Note:  #7a and 3a are similar in previous processing.

**Argon anneal
#1 Clean #1 using 3 minutes ultrasonic acetone, DI rinse spray ~1min., 
NOTE:  THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1a (for argon); these are now reversed.
N2 blow dry.
Purge RTA 10 min at 4.2l/min argon.
RTA in Argon 20s at 700C.
Result:  brown film on top. darker at edges.  nonhomogeneous; lighter
region 3mm teardrop near center.

#7a: Only blow clean.  2 min 120C hotplate dry.
RTA Argon 20s 700C.

#3a: only ~1min purge in RTA (accident--should be 10)  
RTA Argon 20s 700C (much worse:  purple at edges).

#6a: as #7a but rinse in isopropanol first, then blow, 1min hotplate.  
It slid partially off the support wafer during RTA.  
looks like #7a (pretty good)

Hypothesis--maybe the brown is a Ti/Si oxide. The two worst: #1a may have had 
some water vapor.#3a didn't purge.

#5a: process as #6a (acetone/DI/dry/isopropyl/dry/hotplate). 
Add a second anneal:  20s at 850C.

#8a and 
#9a as in 7a (only blow clean with UHP N2).
Add a second anneal:  20s at 850C.


**Argon anneal (mistake, should have been nitrogen)

CLEAN:
#3 and
#5 and
#6:
cleaned as #6a (first part done as a batch).

#1a and
#7 and
#8 and
#9:
blow clean.

#6 and
#8 and
#1a:
purge and RTA 700C 20s argon 
Etch*  NH4OH/H2O2/DI 10ml:20ml:70ml @29C.
RTA 850C 20s argon

#3 and
#5 and
#7 and
#9:
RTA 700C 20s argon, then 850C 20s argon.
NOTE: #3 has brown around edges.


**Nitrogen anneal (finally)

CLEAN:
#4
#4a
#4b (cleaved from #4a)
blow clean

#4
#4a (not argon)
purge and RTA 700C nitrogen
RTA 850C nitrogen.

#4b:
purge and RTA 700C 20s nitrogen 
Etch*  NH4OH/H2O2/DI 10ml:20ml:70ml @30C.
RTA 850C 20s argon
purge and RTA 700C 20s nitrogen


later: Auger analysis for silicide.
TUrns out TiSi on wafer was rough, on order of hundreds of angstroms deep pits.
Nitrogen annealed did not form silicide.

REAL SAMPLES
Preprocessing:  5 min HF dip, 5 in DI dip, light blowoff.   300A Ti a 1x10-7 torr (320V, 300mA, 240mTorr Ar.)

7/30/96 auger analysis not back, but process samples.  4 are broken
(leave 2 on right edge of tape), 5 good ones. 

Make wafer boat for RTA:  take strips of wafer w/ about 1300A oxide,
face down on clean carrier wafer.  RTA argon 1200C 200s.  One strip is bonded.
Move others slightly, and redo at 1220 100s.  No furter bonding, but not moving,
so use as is.

Clean samples; had been mounted to a wafer with carbon dag. 
Soak in petri dish of TCA 5 min takes of carbon dag.  transfer to a wipe.
clean TCA 5 min.  Actone soak 5 minutes.  Dip in clean acetone and then let dry.
One more BROKEN in cleaning (flipped over).

Check proceedure with One bad one with no purge @ 700C 20s in Ar.  OK.  
Place third from right on tape.

Anneal two more bad ones:  purge Ar 15 minutes at flow of 35 on scale.  
Anneal  them @700C for 20s in Ar. Then @850C for 20s in Ar.
Place as 4th and 5th from right on tape.

Anneal two good ones:  purge Ar  15 minutes at flow of 35 on scale.  
Anneal  them @700C for 20s in Ar. Then @850C for 20s in Ar.
Place as 1st and 2nd  from left on tape.

Anneal two good ones:  purge N2  15 minutes at flow of 65 on scale.  
(After 5 min of purge, heat 2s at 300C to drive off any water vapor).
Anneal  them @700C for 20s in N2 flow 35 on scale.  
Remove one and etch as * above.  Rinse 3x by petri dish soak in DI + 1x in acetone.
Purge 15 min in N2.  
(After 5 min of purge, heat 2s at 300C to drive off any water vapor).
Anneal both @850C for 20s in N2.
Place unetched one as 3rd from left on tape.
Place etched one as 4th from left on tape.

9/17/96 Jim and Leon
Clean 7 samples:  5 min soak in TCA, transfer to wipe, soak 5 min in acetone,
dip in clean acetone, transfer to wipe, air dry.

New support wafer for RCA (n-type 3-5 ohm; previous was p-type), and new
support strips.

Purge #1, #2 in Argon 15 minutes.	
Anneal in argon 700C 20s (note, it took longer than normal to reach
800C, about 9 seconds--seemed to stick at 600C for about 4  seconds,
however it went the full 20s at 700C)
then anneal in argon  at 850c for 20 s.

Purge #3, #4, #5 in Argon 15 minutes and anneal as above at 700 and 850C.
#5 flipped over.  Same glitch at 600C on the way up to 700C.

#3, #4 then etched in NH4OH/H2O2/DI 10ml:20ml:70ml @30C for 5 min (as * above),
and re-annealed at 850C for 20s.

Purge #6, #7 with NITROGEN.
Anneal in nitrogen at 700C 20s.
Etch #7 only in NH4OH/H2O2/DI 10ml:20ml:70ml @30C for 5 min (as * above),
aneal #6 and #7 at 850C for 20s.
#7 flipped over during anneal (? or before?).

4/23/97 with Leon.
Clean 9 samples; 5min TCA, xfer to wipe, 5 min acetone soak, dip clean acetone, xfer to wipe, air dry.  lost one in clean.  
Plan:  3 samples Ar only, 2 samples ar, etch, N2, 3 samples N2, etch, N2.

All purges are 15 minutes @35 on gauge  in gas used for anneal.
Etch is  NH4OH/H2O2/DI 10ml:20ml:70ml @29C, then rinse DI 5 min, 10 sec DI, 
dip second rinse, dip in acetone (less residue since can't blow dry).
Used a new wafer with 2800A oxide as platform in RTA. 
Put Si strips on it to hold samples in place.

#1-5 purge, 700C 20s Ar anneal, then 850C 20s Ar anneal.
#1-3 are done.
#4,5  etch 5 min  then 850 N2. 

#7-9 purge, 700C 20s N2, etch, 850C 20s Ar.
