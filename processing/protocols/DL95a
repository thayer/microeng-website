PROTOCOL DL95a

CLEAN(semicond grade solvents):
10s flow acetone rinse (with pen markings down)
10s flow TCA rinse
10 min soak acetone
10s flow acetone
10s flow methanol
blow dry UHP N2 gas
10 minute at 120C bake dry

LITHO
spin on Shipley 1813 @700/4000RPM
prebake 30 minutes at 120C
expose 15s at 15mW
develop 80s puddle+10s@200rpm
rinse 60s@200-500rpm
dry 60s@4000 rpm
bake 30 minutes at 120C

ETCH
10s in metal etch (3:3:1:1 H3PO4:HNO3:CH3COOH:DI) w/ agitation
(note: center clears in 3 s; outer ring in 6 s)
strip in 60s in acetone or ACT (takes off 1st Cu layer) w/ agitation

DL95b
replace CLEAN with:
30s flow IPA rinse spinning 700RPM
30s flow DI rinse spinning 700RPM
60s spin dry at 4000RPM with N2 flow for 10s.
(note, acetone may cause pealing?)

DL95c
Samples are rougher (including pinholes) and thicker (1.4 microns). 
as DL95b but
(1) 30s flow Acetone spinning 700RPM first. 
(2) eliminate 10s flow develop
(3) ETCH as follows:
80sec in FeCl3 solution (Radio Shack 7705080 full strength PCB etchant)
(took about 50s to clear mostly, but still a bridge or two at 60s;
after 80s no bridges, but lines a bit undercut; not the cleanest
etch I've seen)
(note, on a test sample the 3:3:1:1 took 5 minutes to clear.)
