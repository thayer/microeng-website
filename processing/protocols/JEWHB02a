TPX polished by Mineral Optics (Wilder VT).
Cr (100A)/Au(2000A) deposited in physics by Chris Berven thermal evaporator.
Pressure 5*10-6 torr.

Rinsed in DI, dried in 12C oven 5 minutes.  Cooled 5 minutes.
Spin on S1813, bake 10 mintues at 90C.
Expose 8s at 26.4mW.  Overexposed; no line is some regions.
Dissolve off PR with acetone, clean, dry bake, cool, respin.
Expose 6.5s.  Good except one area 10% of sample where 
no lines (overexposed)  Best exposure probably between these were there
not a defect preventing contact.

* NOTE:  11/15 run found new PR, 90C bake 8s exposure good.  At that time had ad
hesion problems.  See mask aligner log.

Printing 2um lines on 4um centers over 2inch diameter substrate.

Substrates (3):  Machine polished TPX disks (2inch diameter x 3mm thick, polished by Mineral Optics in Wilder, VT) coated with 10nm Cr and 200nm Au with M. Wybourne's evaporator at 1*10^-6 mBar.  

Prebake for 10min @90C.
S1813 resist:  5s@900rpm, 60s @4000rpm.
BAKE 10min @90C.
Expose 6s @207W/26.0mW.  Substrate raised 3 full turns from focus.
Develop with MF319 for 60s then DI for 35s@300rpm then N2 @3700rpm for 60s.
Postbake for 5min @90C.

All three exposures look good!
