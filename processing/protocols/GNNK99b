Yes, we've got the structures! At least on 200k scale there was no readable
electrical resistivity between the features.
The etching of Au (unknown thinckness, we assumed 1000A) took 24 seconds
the etching of Ti sublayer (assumed 100 A) took 2 minutes in buffered
13%HF+NH3F solution at room temperature.
Thank you,

Sincerely,
Niyaz
