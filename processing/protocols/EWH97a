PMMA and fluorescent dye, spin on, ebeam litho.

Look at fading of various dyes:
A.(already done)  1 part: Rhodamine 6G (7mg/ml Methanol) +  10 parts 6% PMMA
B.  1 part: difluorofluroscein  (3.5mg/ml Methanol) +  10 parts 6% PMMA
C.  1 part: carboxylic based hexaflorofluorescein  (3.5mg/ml Methanol) +  10 parts 6% PMMA
D.  1 part: fluoroscein  (2.75mg/ml Methanol) +  10 parts 6% PMMA
E. ~2mg (3ml) of 0.3 micron alumina powder in 5ml of PMMA.

Clean slides9 2x2":  5 minutes DI ultrasonic, 5 min Acetone, 5 min Methanol.

Spin on at 4000RPM A-E.
G.  Add .5ml each of conc "slowfade lite" (Molecular probes) to half of B 
H.  Add .5ml each of conc "slowfade lite" (Molecular probes) to half of C 
I.  Add .5ml each of conc "slowfade lite" (Molecular probes) to half of D 
J. Add chlorobenzene to (G)  to bring to 60%(6%PMMA) 40%(chlorobenzend) and spin on.

NOTE:  when add slowfade lite, the solutions change color (more red, less yellow)

Bake at 170C for 30 minutes.
