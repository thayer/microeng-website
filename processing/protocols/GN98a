Au electrodes

PREVIOUSLY WITH BRENT BECKER:  16 leads Ti/Au on <100> Si.  fab done 2/20/98.
Liftoff in stil acetone incomplete after 15 min.  Ultrasonic acetone, find
peeled film dissolves into fine particles, so would have been better
to change acetone with already removed film before ultrasonic.
After 2hr find 75% of devices are ok.  others have small regions of 
incomplete liftoff.  Geoff and Brent are happy; I'd like to try
ACT next time.  May need more overhang in photoresist.  cgl. 

7/7/98
100 Si p-type 3-10 ohm-cm.
OXIDE
wafer 1: 1200C 5 min (840A)
wafer 2: 250s 750A
wafer 3: 250s 685A


PHOTOLITH  standard shipley 1813.  2.5 turns pressure.
wafers1-2 6 s exposure.  Too long; should be equal space and line; see only about 20%/80% space/PR.  (part of the problem is that they are not equal in the mask).

New bowl.

wafer3: 4.5 s exposure.  Better.  Perhaps 35%/65%, though some spots in clear region could be underexposure or could be a glitch in the rinse (water dried on sample).  Exposed entire wafer except one edge, developed, rinsed off in ACT.  Clean except near edge.  
Respin on photoresist.  Beautiful PR spin (one splashbk). 
4.0s exposure. Looks great except at edge where some of the first printing pattern remains.

wafer4: 5 s exposure.  Some ok (30/70?), a few contacts have very small gap.

BEST for future:  4 second exposure.

LIFTOFF  wafer #4 in ACT.  
Little action without ultrasound.  
15 min in ultrasound and 
devices look good.


7/14/98  
NOTE:  The mask has features smaller than we'd like, so.  We are pushing
the exposure down as short as we can get away with to try and enlarge them.
This makes us much more sensitive to resist thickness variations.

Wafers 5-  250s 1200C oxide.

Wafer 5: 4100RPM 4s exposure.  Underexposed; spots in clear region.
Start over (blanket expose 10 sec, develop, wash in ACT)
?RPM

Wafer 6: 4000RPM? 4.5s exposure. Large blobs of PR left in clear region, probably where
splashback streaks were.  Add a second 1 minute of develop.  All these
defects are gone, and fingers are OK, though not much larger than the mask
(they were quite nice after the first develop).

Wafer 7: 3900RPM?  Keep exposure up for good sidewalls, but reduce develop.  
5s exposure.  Start with 30s develop.  Quite incomplete--add 15s. Still some
PR particularly in small lines.  Add 15s (now 60s total develop). 

Wafer 8: 3900RPM?  5s exposure, 60s develop.  Looks good. (maybe the slightly
thicker PR does better with 5s exposure; 13200A vs 13000A thickness.

Wafer 9: 3900RPM.  5s exposure in HP mode (previous in standard mode).
Looks better yet.

Wafer 10:  3900RPM.  5s exposure in HP mode.  Note, the wafer dropped off 
more quickly after contact than usual. Great--as good as #9.
