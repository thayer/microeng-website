FIRST MASK (for Ni only):
8s exposure, 30s develope, 60s rinse
2s blanket exposure, 15s develop, 60s rinse
112s etch (without a bake first) in CR7, strip in ACT
looks good; many less defects in light field region
than w/o blanket exposure.

SECOND MASK:
8s exposure, 30s develop, 60s rinse
2s blanket exposure (dial at min), 15s develop, 60s rinse
20 min @120C bake
112s etch in CR7, strip in ACT
looks equally good.
