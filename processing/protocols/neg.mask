TO make a netative copy of a mask:

Remove positive pr from chrome plate in ACT
Dry in 120C oven for 5 minutes.
HCR120 negative resist:  dispense  full pipette
let spread for 10 seconds
spin 6 sec at 700 RPM, 60s at 4000-RPM (expect .95 microns).
soft bake at 70C for 6 minutes.
expose 2seconds at 10mW/cm2 (that's an overexposure--may not be necessary, but it's hard to expose less with our lamp; 6mW/cm2 causes it to extinguish).
develop is critical else get particles of PR depositing everywhere.
(this may only occur if use a DI rinse instead of butyl acetate)
20sec puddle with full pipette of developer
20sec 150rpm, 2 pipettes of developer
10sec 700rpm, 1 pipette of developer
20sec 700rpm, 2 pipettes of n butyl acetate
5sec 4000rpm, 1 pipette n butyl acetate (unnecessar?)
(actual was about 30sec dev at 150-700, then 2 on nbutyl acetate at 4000)
60sec 4000rpm dry
hardbake 8 min at 125C
etch mask in CR7 for about 2 minutes.
strip with microstrip at 70C (neither microstrip at RT nor ACT at 70C work)
