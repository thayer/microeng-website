Jacob Halbrooks/Garmire: Pattern glass substrate for modeshaping
SUBSTRATE: Use 2" glass substrate cgl stock (note, variaton in thickness of
these three substrates from one to the next is less than 100
microns (one 2/3 turn).
CLEAN: 3 min acetone ultrasonic, acetone rinse, propanol rinse, blow dry.
PRIME: HMDS 10s, PR spin cycle
RESIST:  S1813 PR 
BAKE:  5 min bake on hotplate set to 110C (surface gets to 100C)
EXPOSURE: 8 s.  DEV 60 s.
(The mask, an old one from Lashmore group, didn't have bubble defect eliminaton,
so follow this by  1s blanket exposure in soft contact mode and 30s develop)
BAKE: 5 min bake hotplate 110C
Wipe back w/ ACTto be sure no PR there.
ETCH: 10% BHF etch (old...slow...7 min gives only 1750angstroms).  Problem
may be in type of glass (unknown).  After 22 minutes PR started to peel.Take 
remaining two samples and:
BAKE 10 min hotplate @150C (sample about 125), then 5 min at 170C (sample
got to 140C as indicated by spot check on top of similar substrate).
ETCH:
STRIP: ACT 30s room T.
