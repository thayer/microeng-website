1/11/01 binary optical elements.  See also CS96a.

Using 1/26/96 mask
Chris S. suggested design as before, or for 633nm; text 
printed on mask says 250 and 500nm deep.  Last time we did
about 600 and 300nm; that's close to 633 and 316nm.  We'll
aim to repeat 600 and 300nm.

Substrate is E610250, 25.4mm diam, 6.35mm 10' parallelism, 1/4 lambda flat
window from Esco 800-922-3726.

Mask aligner:  remove wafer chuck, slide out the tray, place
spinner chuck on bottom.  Then substrate just fits under mask.
Use contact lever (not sep'n lever) to adjust height for alignment.
Align first level by focusing just below mask onto wafer and lining up
the mask rings around the central one with the edge of the substrate.
Align second level only on the central ring; can see all at once.


#1 blow off, spin PR, bake 15 min 120C, expose 4.5s, develop/rinse/dry 
60/30/30s.   
#2,3 same but clean in acetone and also use HMDS, and use 5.5s exposure,
and 10 minute bakes.

Etch 3 minutes, use microswab w/ ACT to take off resist near the edge,
alpha-step; need 15 s more to get 640 reading (601nm real since alpha
step reads 6% high).  Etch 15s more and indeed get 640nm (coarse features).  
Similarly, find 1min 15 sec plus 17 seconds for 320nm second etch.

Find some foggy film on etched surface, not completely removed by ACT.
A light wipe takes it off. Not sure what it was.

NOTE:  some troubles with photoresist left in exposed regions; is HMDS
contributing to this problem?

1/18/01
1-2 3 min, 3-5 5 min acetone ultrasound
PR1813 (no HMDS). 10 min bakes.
5.5s exposures.
mask w/ print on right as in holder.
Use pattern 4th from R.
align vertical just inside of 2nd ring,
horiz about half between two outer rings.
#1 and #2 etched for three minutes.  #4,5 done final baking, but still need to
be etched.  The mask is cleaned.  #5 still needs to be exposed.


1/25/01 status
All 5 are etched first pattern.  some yet need the up indicator scratched
on the side.
#1good 
#2 only 4500 angstroms.  weird one--lost the photoresist apparently before done.
#3 good 6200A
#4 good 6350A
#5 good 6000A+15s etch unmeasured.
#8 etch good and 2nd level litho good, ready for 2nd etch.

#1-5 all aligned and printed second level (finer lines).  All cleaned backside
by swabing with ACT and rinsing.


#6(previously in slot 8 just to keep it separate)  was printed at earlier date. 
5.5s exposure.  note, #1 spun off before PR spun on...,#2 spun off during
development...both cleaned with acetone and  redone (possible additional
contamination).
#2--when spun with developer, the speed settings were set for the photoresist,
most likely (not developer).  hope that's okay
