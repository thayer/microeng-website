interdigited electrode mask
40 microns=(line+space).
August 1, 1995
normal density film from laserlab (film thickness 100 microns = .68 divisions)
12s exposure@15mW/cm2
30s puddle develop TMAH
60s rinse DI
2.5s blanket UV exposure
15s puddle develope TMAH
60s rinse DI
50s etch CR7s
120s strip ACT
NOTES:  the blanket develop was effective in eliminating some
bridges between the electrodes which were caused by bubbles in
the lino film.
