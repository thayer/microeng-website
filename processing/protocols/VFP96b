7/96: Goal: Ice FET using highly conducting wafers 
for back gate (~10E19 doping).  About 1200A gate oxide, 
Ti/Au pattern source/drain, ice active layer.  
For a start, make two samples using etching as VFP96a, plus one
using liftoff (VFP95b, but negmask nor neg photoresist)

WAFERS: <111> n type <.003 ohm-cm 360-400 micron (Crysteco/Reticon As13*2x (qty 16 from Wafernet 6/19)

Verify ohmic contacts using indium solder (high doping implies tunneling throughschottky barrier).  Linear IV +_1V (w/ 100ohm series).

7/16/96
Cleave <111> from wafernet.  Cleave is perpendiuclar to the major flat.  Saved a piece which shows both cleave planes (NOT RCA CLEANED).
Etch small piece in 13%HF.  Immediate beading on polished side; 4 minutes to bead on back side in HF.  Back nolonger beads in DI rinse.

7/17/96
Strip oxide in HF.
RCA Clean all 16 wafers (also clean 8 from part 31225 n type 3-5ohm-cm; 
not used for this work).

Dry oxide at 1010C for about 2 hr (as in VFP95b) flow 2SCFH; 
400C at 11:40AM, 540C at 11:46, 690C at 11:52, 837C at noon.
Turn down at 2:06pm; 789C at 2:45, 690 at 3:05.
Move to furnace edge at 3:25 (at 640C).  Royal blue.
1366A (1.462=n@6328), 1391(1.458=n@8300) (2% variation center to edge)

Make neg. mask.  
Defect in one device (large);  not particularly nice looking mask.

7/18
Deposit Ti/Au in Wilder evaporator.  Two wafers at once.
Inficon:  150A of Ti, 600A of Au.  Allphastep says ~900A total.
Looks good.

7/19
Two wafers; #2 had gold on both sides of flat.
#1 cleaned DI/Acetone/Methanol+1min hotplate, 3min cool.  Shipley 1813PR.
Exposed with wrong mask (defects).  Stripped with ACT, cleaned with DI,
dried 1min hotplate, 3min cool.  
Correct mask  has one large device off the side.
Shipley 1813PR, 6s@15mW/cm2, 60sdev.  Looks good.

#2 blow clean, Shipley 1813PR...as #1

#1: 10s of Au etch at room temperature; just the slightest 
cloud of Au left.  Add 15 s and it's clear.
30s in fresh Si etch  70% HNO3, 25%HAc, 5% H at room temperature;
maybe a bit much; photoresist attacted rather badly, but looks like the Au held up fine.
Strip in ACT at room temperature. Verify resistivity away from features is off
scale on Fluke (>40Mohm over 2mm), and that some oxide has etched 
(so all Ti is gone).  1170A of oxide left of the original 1368A. 
Also checked Au resistivity on the partial device; saw 180 ohms
from pad to end of one line (breaking through photoresist).

#2 as above but 21s in Au etch and 10s in Si etch to avoid any possible
attack of Au surface by Si etch.  At end 1367A, 1390A (i.e. no loss).
Maybe didn't get all the Ti.  Ohmmeter reads >40Mohm
Should have etched another 5 seconds, but already stripped.

Both samples look reasonably good.  #1 has a large defect in the partial
device.
