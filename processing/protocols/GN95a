GN95a:AFM calibration target.
05/08/95
Oxide ridges on Si.  

Mask:  /levey/ssml/processing/lithography/masks/STM.calibration

Sample 1 (pattern offset to avoid resist defect)
120s@1200C for 460A oxide.  Add 60s for (555A).
Standard litho for Shipley PR but 7s exposure, 60s develop
Etch in 5%HF (in NH4F) until bead + 10% (about 1.5 min)
FINAL:  535A modulation
555A ridges; estimate 20A in channels (may grow a bit with time).

Sample 2 (etched blob near edge where PR removed with acetone)
380A oxide.  same litho, but remove some PR at edge to allow ellip of etched region.
After etch/strip, 10s in RTA at 1200C.
FINAL:  315A modulation
385A ridges; measured 70A channels.  channel height should be stable w/ time.
