12/6/95  NEG PHOTORESIST

TEST WAFER (leftover es194 w/ only oxide)
Spin HCR120 neg photoresist at 4000RPM
bake hotplate 90C 3 min
expose 15mW/cm2 2sec
develop 20s puddle, 35s H20 rinse at 1000RPM, 60s dry @4000RPM
OBSERVE something inhomo across wafer...fringes on wafer; 
fringe pattern is on 1" scale. green-red-green-blue
alphastep gives 7000A features (PR should be 9000 microns thick).

SAMPLE WAFER:
CEMAT ptype <100> 1-10 ohm-cm 331-431micron thick
previously RCA cleaned
Dry oxide at 1010C for about 2hr.
wafer looks like it was not cleaned well; some residue visible
Get:  1202A n(6328A)=1.46, n(8300A)=1.460
Spin HCR120 at 3000RPM this time (for thicker resist)
bake hotplate 90C 3 min
expose 15mW/cm2 2sec
develop 20s puddle, 35s n butyl acetate.   rinse at 1000RPM, 60s dry @4000RPM
also see fringe pattern on this.  
In addition, see clouds of defects a few microns in size.
Uncertain whether they came from original wafer (unclean) or from
develop/rinse.  Additional rinse w/ butyl acetate does not help.
