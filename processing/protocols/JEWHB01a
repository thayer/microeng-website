Here are the notes from the last run (7/31-8/1) making polarizers.  See you on Monday.  -Hayden

Au on Ti on TPX (hand polished, ~10um deep scratches).

Deposition:
6e-6 Torr.
10 sccm Ar flow.
Ti @160W for 2 min into chamber to act as getter.
Ti @160W for 30 sec.
Au @60W for 3 min. (Note previous run indicated 6 min produced 5000A thickness.)

Resist: S1813 @900 rpm for 5 sec, then @4000 rpm for 50 sec.

Bake: 10 min @120 deg C.

Expose:  9.5 sec @27 mW/cm^2.  Substrate was raised three turns (450 um) above focus position.  A dense, symmetric diffraction pattern was clearly visible.

Develop:  MF913 puddle for 1 min.  Then rinse and spin @300 rpm for 35 sec followed by N2 and spin at 3500 rpm for 30 sec.

Bake:  for 10 min @120 deg C.

Etch:
17s Gold Etch.
16s Ti etch (1% HF in DI H20).  No visible effect.
10s Gold.  Slightly transparent.
5s Gold.  Better uniformity, center still more opaque.
15s Ti.
4s Gold.
15s Ti.
30s Ti.  Much clearer.  Light meter indicates 50% transmission.  Strong diffraction visible.  Lines look like the mask under the microscope (ignoring the large scratches).

Strip.
