Some notes on the procedures of photolithography.

1. Turn on UV lamp.=20
-To do that: open AIR, VACUUM valves, turn on power ON on the right =
panel from the microscope.
-Turn timer on (right side).
-Turn lamp power ON on the left side.

2. Clean masks (might have some dust and dirt).
- Put aspen on, glasses on, gloves on.
- Place  masks into blue holders.
- Put masks into ACT for more then 1 minute, shake periodically. =
Use ACT clean, and baker for ACT clean.
- Wash masks with DI water.
- Blow with dry nitrogen to dry
- Bring masks over clean bench without talking.

3. Put mask into mask holder, push button VACUUM MASK on the right =
to keep mask on holder. Place mask holder with mask into aligner.

4. Put photoresist Shipley S1813 on wafer.
- Turn POWER on on the spinner. See =
http://thayer.dartmouth.edu/~microeng/equipment/spinner/spinner.html=

- Hit POWER RESET button.
- Voltmeter on.
- Use two buttons START, STOP to start and stop spinning.
- Put wafer and wafer holder in spinner and center them.
- Set T1, T2, f1, f2
- Spill photoresist while wafer rests. Use not more then half of =
glass tube.
- Hit START and wait until spinning stops.
- Transfer wafer onto hotplate at 120 C and bake for 3 minutes.
- Cool wafer for 3-5 minutes on cold wafer holder (clean before).

5. Meanwhile check UV LAMP intensity.
- remove any miscellaneous wafers
- Raise the lever.
- Hit button DS. Hit EXPOSURE.
- Intensity should rise to 26.4 mW/cm2. It is 20% more then was =
before, thus exposure time should be 20% less, i.e. 4 seconds =
(before was 6 seconds).  ***added 10/29/99:  4s is underexposed,
optimum is 7s.

6. Align wafer.=20
- Focus on mask.
- Slide the mask aside.
- Bring wafer into sharp view and lower it by two turns
- Bring mask and wafer into "contact" and make final alignment.=20
- Bring wafer 3 turns up while checking that alignment remains =
intact.

7. Push EXPOSURE to exposure the wafer.

8. Developing.
- f1=3D600 for T1=3D54 s, f2 =3D 2000 for T2=3D60s
- spill evenly starting from the center while wafer is in rest
- wait  60 seconds
- hit START button
- wash with DI water while spinning on low.
