11/95
film from laserlab had smaller space than line (about 45 micron line
to 25 micron space).  Wanted equal.

1.  as in WKSHPmsk.  Glass plate still over msk for 2s exposure.
get about 40 micron space, 30 micron line.

2.  as above but expose for 16s then 2s.
close to equal, though some lines are wider than others (laserlab problem
or design?)
