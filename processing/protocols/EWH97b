e-beam litho test for resolution target.
Plan--gate ebeam in a scan to create lines with sharp edges.
May try heavy bake and then flow Rhodamine in grooves.
Also do Ti/Au (or alumina?) liftoff to create grooves.

Substrates:
#1 1/2 cover slips, uncoated
ITO glass from Lashmore 
   measures about 40 ohms over a square
Ti/Au coated thin (.0075") slide (glass:Harvard, coating:Symma)
   measures about 20  ohms over a square
Note: #1 cover slip measures .005", #1 1/2 cover slip measures .0065"

Clean as in EWH97a and spin on 6%PMMA at 4000 RPM.
bake at 170C 30 minutes.


EXPOSURE:  found .10nA best (.05 was clearly undrexposed).
DEVELOP: 60s in 1:3, 30s in 1:5 (MIBK) as in 93-2p.56.
(should call and find out if stock developer is already diluted).

Another test specimin--spin on PMMA/R6G and test resistance to
HF etch (5% in NH4F).  Find that HF hardens the PMMA so it will not come off
in chlorobenzene or methylene chloride.  Really tough.  Can feel
increased friction in area with PMMA vs glass.  MIcrostrip at 35C
nor ACT at RT will take it off either.  Try HF in DI as well; it
SEEMS OK.  May be that the NH4F is hardening the PMMA?
