TMAH can attack Al.

It can be used for silicon etching if dopants are added to passivate
the aluminum.  see:
  http://transducers.stanford.edu/stl/Publications/PDF-files/ErnoThesis.pdf

TMAH is present in developer and even in the low concentrations there will
do some etching of the aluminum.  In the presence of other metals this
etching can be dramatically enhanced.  (exposed Ti and Aluminum is a bad
combination, for instance...)

Dilute TMAH will attack Al, but not Cr or Pt.  People often use TMAH based
developers such as AZ300MIF as an Al etchant.  AZ makes a positive developer
that will not attack Al (Simply called AZ 1:1 Developer)I am not sure if
more concentrated TMAH will attack Cr.  About the only thing that will
attack Pt is Aqua Regia.

platinum and chrome aer OK indefinitely, but the material the chrome is
deposited on will maybe be affected.  aluminum is REPORTEDLY ok after a
sufficient amount of aluminum is dissolved into the TMAH bath, but i've
never verified that experimentally myself (as you may know, sometimes other
researchers' results are not as useful as they seem from journal paper!).
i think you have to dissolve a lot of aluminum into the bath.  suggest you
avoid aluminum if at all possible.

TMAH does etch Al. Ever wonder why there are faint etch marks in Al

TMAH at about 25% and around 80C etches Al and Cr.  It does no etch Pt.
I heard of additives that reduce dramatically Al etching, but I don't know
the details.
Some is linked to predissolved Silicon in the TMAH.

Subject: Pt,Cr,Al and TMAH

Hello,

I have not tried TMAH with Pt, Cr, or Al but I have some information which
might be of interest to you.

First,  I have worked with Pt lines on sensors and I don't think that TMAH
would attack it since EDP and KOH do not significantly attack the metal.
If TMAH does attack the metal then let me know since the only other wet
etchant for Pt is aqua regia at 90 C.

Cr's compatibility with TMAH I do not know.

There are several papers which discuss how to keep TMAH from attacking
Aluminum.  The first papers used powdered silicon then this migrated to the
Aluminum.  The first papers used powdered silicon then this migrated to the
addition of chemicals to replace the powdered silicon.  You may find it
hard to get a combination which doesn't attack silicon while giving a good
siicon bulk etch.  If you are only removing poly from filled trenches or
something than you should be fine.

You can buy some chemicals named "Pad Etch". They are made for etching

I know of a dry etch technique I used several times: reactive ion
etching in a CF4 plasma. If you need good selectivity to silicon you
should add CHF3. Aluminum is not attacked at all.
Good luck,

You can use a buffered HF etch that will not etch Al (like BOE or
Transene).
This will be isotropic of course (wet etches) but will work if you
aren't
trying to look deep.   If you want to see several layers simulataneously
you
will have to use an anisotropic etch

If you have access to an RIE, you can use any fluorine chemistry (SF6,
CHF3,
CF4)to etch silicon dioxide anisotropically (dry etches).   None of them

will touch aluminum (although sputtering will occur eventually).  For
maximun etch rates use a mixture with 10% O2 added.  If you are looking
very
deep (more than two layers) you will need a deep etching ICP-RIE.

Good luck,

Marisa

Marc,

I assume you wet etch the Cr under Au.  The undercut problem is due to an
electrochemical reaction known as "galvanic reaction".  The reaction occurs
whenever there are two dissimilar metals in contact and one of them is
being wet etched.  The etching of Cr, in your case, is accelerated by the
existence of Au.  Try TiW (10/90) as an adhesion layer and etch it in
H2O2.  It works well for us.

Good luck,

Jamie Yao

Dear Dr. Johnson,

concerning your e-mail you send around on May, 20th, where you asking
for other options for grayscale lithography than Canyon Materials'HEBS,
I can answere with YES.

At ISIT we improve and apply graytone lithography utilizing an
inexpensive one-step lithographic method using a raster-screend
(graytone) quartz-Cr reticle, with subresolution pixel elements. This
typ of mask you can get at any commercial mask shop and you are able to
mix graytone structures with digital once. Graytone specific is only the
design of the subresolution pixel arrays. For this we developed a
software tool called GRADED which we use in house. This tool takes
account of all nonlinear process characteristics which happens during
the graytone exposure like e.g. resist contrast. In addition we have a
resist process available allowing thicknesses up to 20 um. Combining
these two technologies we are able to fabricate fluid jets, shaped
electrodes for electrostatic drives, shaped mirrors, shaped gratings,
refractive and diffractive optical elements. We also transfere this
structures in silicon e.g. for IR-applications or make replicas of these
structures in Polycarbonat together with an industrial partner.

For more detailed information there are some publications available:
- Proc. SPIE Vol. 3008, p. 279-299, San Jose 1997
- Proc. SPIE Vol. 3226, p. 6, Austin, 1997
- Proc. of Int. Conf. on Optic & Electronics at IRDE, India, 9-12 Dec,
1998

Hello Colleagues:

I wanted to thank everyone out there who responded to my question about
patterning of Silicon Nitride.  A lot of you have asked for any
information that I get from the MEMS community about this question. 
Attached please find the original question that I asked and various
replies that I received. 

I also wanted to point out the book where I found that Silicon Nitride
can be etched using sodium hydroxide solution.  The Title of the book
is "Handbook of Metal Etchants" by Perrin Walker and William H. Tarn
from CRC Press.  ISBN 0-8493-3623-6

The recipe as they have written is as follows :
"NaOH :90 g
H2O :250 ml
Temperature: boiling
Rate of etching :180 A/min
Resist used : KMER

Glycerin or etylene glycol can be added for additional rate control."
Some other good references that this book points out are as follows : 
7 Wurzbach, J A & Grunthaner, F J --- J of Appl Physics, 130, 690
(1983)
7 Hess, D W ---J of Vac Sci Technology, A(2), 243, (1984)

Original Question

Hello Colleagues:

I am looking for a photoresist to pattern silicon nitride thin film. 
Specifically I wanted to use KMER resist as it goes well with dilute
NaOH solution which I am planning to use as an etchant for silicon
nitride. If someone can give me some information where to get this KMER
resist from, I will appreciate that very much.

Alternatively If someone can suggest 
(1) some other photoresist that goes well with dilute solution of NaOH 
or 
(2) some other etchant for silicon nitride (other then anything that
contains HF)

I will be very thankful.  

My e-mail address is "ricky_25@yahoo.com"

Hi Vikas,

I'm assuming you can't use plasma etch, which is the standard nitride
etch process.  There are chemistries that are highly selective to
oxide, which can be grown under the nitride, if you're trying not to
damage the
Silicon surface.  Wet etching nitride is rarely used by anyone, though
it is commonly stripped with concentrated HF.

The only nitride etch I've ever used is phosphoric acid (which must be
refluxed to maintain it's concentration).  Oxide (LTO or some other
deposited film) can be used as a mask, and some other metals may also
be suitable (check a standard metal corrosion reference for
compatibility). I wasn't aware that NaOH etched nitride, but I'd be
interested in any references you have.

Sorry I can't be of any more help.  Good luck.

I did experiment to etch silicon nitride with 49% HF and the etch rate
is about 150 A/min.  I just used AZ 1512 to make patterns but as for
hard bake i hard-baked it at 140 C so it went well until etching 2000
A.
you wanna use KMER resist but i don't know about that so I also wanna
get info thank you to read.

By using dry etching (SF6 for example) in a RIE, any resist will have a
selectivity of at least 5. But it may not suit your needs... otherwise
wet etching nitride is done with a good selectivity to oxide (I guess
it is why you don't want HF) using hot (near boiling point) H3PO4 acid.
However you need a recirculating bath to keep the concentration steady
or the selectivity drops. Fume hood the least you should use... Usually
standard photoresist sustain the treatment too, with a good selectivity
(at least 2, I guess, but I don't know:-).

We have been getting good results with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as it
does not attack the resists very much.

If you get info on resists compatible with dilute NaOH/KOH, please do
Pass it on to me.

RIE plasma etch is the best way to etch silicon nitride and maintain
photoresist integrity. Any commercial positive photoresist will be
better  than KMER. That hasn't been used since I mixed the stuff up
back in
1970. I believe it was made by Kodak if you want to find it, but it was
a rubber based negative working pr that really didn't have too many
good properties. I think KTFR fell in the same catagory.  If you want
to talk etchants and dry etch of silicon nitride give me a call at
480-968-8818.

Hi,

I am interested in the etching of Si3N4. Are you sure that the NaOH can
etch Si3N4? , and usual photoresist can resist for the etching? Please
let me know about wet etching ( I know dry ) of nitride, and
Could you please forward re-mail on this matter to me?

Thanks,

Subject: SUMMARY: SEM Lithography
To: MEMS@ISI.EDU
X-Url: http://mems.isi.edu/mems.html 

Awhile ago, I posted a request for information on purchasing a SEM
lithography system. I have finally summarized what people emailed me and
what I learned while purchasing this machine.

  A SEM lithography system is a SEM with an add-on control system for
lithography. Almost all academic e-beam lithography is done this way.
And it works. Lots of groups routinely do 50 nm lithography in PMMA with
these machines. 

 There are two suppliers of the add-on control hardware/software for
e-beam lithography: Raith and Nabity (see their web pages). Raith sells
a full product line, from the low end add-on controller to turn-key
e-beam lithography machines with laser stages. I am only going to
discuss what we were interested in: e-beam lithography over small areas.
(The Nabity system and the Raith Quantum). The interesting thing is that
the installed base for these two systems are very geographic: Raith is
Europe and Nabity is North America. Since I'm in North America, most of
the people I talked to were Nabity users. Both systems appear to be
comparible, both in price and operating characterisitics. The Nabity
system has a large happy customer base, while I had difficulty
contacting the Raith customer base.

  My comments on which SEM to purchase are strongly based on my
conversations with Joe Nabity. He has been very helpful in giving advice
on what is needed in an SEM. We are users of e-beam lithography. That
is, we want to make structures, but we are not interested in doing R and
D in ebeam lithography. For this reason (and financial ones), we did not
look at FE-SEM based e-beam lithography. It just seems to me that it
will take a few years for all the instrument bugs to be worked out with
Fe-SEMs. 

  For our needs the perfect machine is a high end LaB6, 40 KV SEM. The
problem is that with the advent of FE-SEMs, most of the microscope
manufacturers no longer manufacture high end SEMs that are not FESEMs.
The only two left are Phillips and LEO. And LEO is ending the
manufacturing of their machine. This leaves either the purchase of a new
Phillips or the purchase of a used SEM. Used SEMs will do the job, it
just not as nice looking as a new one. We hope to go with a new machine.

Subject: SUMMARY: Purchasing a Deep Si Etchers 
To: MEMS@ISI.EDU
X-Url: http://mems.isi.edu/mems.html 

Awhile ago, I posted a request for information on purchasing a deep Si
etcher. I have finally summarized what people emailed me and what I
learned while purchasing this machine.

  Our need was for a RIE that can etch deep anistropic structures in
many different materials. To do this, we needed a ICP RIE. A deep Si
etcher is simply a ICP RIE that either runs the Bosch Si process or has
a cryogenic chuck. There are four suppliers of 'turn key' ICP RIE
machines: Plasmatherm, STS, Oxford, and Alcatel (they all have web
pages). These system will perform the desired process right out of the
box. This makes these systems expensive. Budgetary quotes range from $
375 K US to $ 550K US. There are other companies (typically small
companies) that will sell you a RIE with a ICP source on top. Axic and
Trionics (spelling ?) are examples. These system will probably need alot
of process development and possibly equipment modification to work
properly. However, the cost is much less. For a university, this is a
option (Also, it sounds like a nice master's thesis).

  From a construction and maintenance point of view, the turnkey ICP RIE
systems (STS, Plasmatherm, Oxford, and Alcatel), appear to be very
similar. The people who e-mailed me and those who I talked to were all
happy with the machines they purchased (regardless of who made it). For
system that were not in use 24 hours/day, the maintenance costs were all
reasonable (about what you would expect for a complex vacuum system),
with the only issue being problems with the turbo pumps). I did not talk
to the people who run these machines in production).

  From a Si etch process point of view there are differences between the
machines. I am not an expert at deep Si etching, but this is my
understanding: Anistropic Si structures can be etched by either the
Bosch process (a patented gas chemistry) or a cryogenic chuck. The Bosch
process allows for very high aspect ratio/deep Si etches, however the
side walls are scalloped. The cryogenic chuck has smoother sidewalls,
but the etch depth and aspect ratio are not as good as the Bosch
process. The Bosch process has been licensed by PlasmaTherm, STS, and
Alcatel And the cryogenic chuck is on the Oxford and Alcatel machines.

Prices: 
  These machines are very expensive. For a pure Si etching application,
there are a number of comapnies and universities selling Deep Si etching
services. If we were only going to etch Si, this the route we would have
taken. Since we want to do many materials, we needed to bite the bullet
and spend the money. 
  
  The initial quotes from all the companies should be considered
budgetary, that is a beginning place for negotiation. There is quite a
bit of room for movement on the prices. The prices that various places
paid for their systems is 'known', you need to ask around. From my
experience, the Oxford system was the least expensive and we purchased
the Oxford system.

Subject: SUMMARY: Suppliers of Hot Embossers
To: MEMS@ISI.EDU
X-Url: http://mems.isi.edu/mems.html 

Awhile ago, I posted a request for information on purchasing a hot
embosser. I have finally summarized what people emailed me and what I
learned while purchasing this machine.

  There is only a single supplier of hot embossers designed for
micromachining applications; Jenoptik (they have a web page). There are
other companies that supply hot embossrs, but they are for more
tradiational industries. It is unclear if these other machines will do
what the MEMS community needs. I received e-mail from people who were
considering building their own machines, but I don't know how that has
progressed.

  The feeling in the MEMS community is that the present Jenoptik
machines are R and D/small production run machines, not machines for
mass production. This isn't surprizing considering the infancy of the
plastic MEMS field. I would assume as soon as someone needs a production
machine, that a comapny somewhere will offer it.

Using Hoechst's AZ4562, we get 12 micron patterns with the following
conditions:

-80" spinning at 1000 rpm
-30' softbake at 100C
-90" illumination at 5 mW/cm2
-developing using AZ531 developer
-hardbake

Subject: Summary of Ledit and Postscript for Masks
To: MEMS@ISI.EDU
X-Url: http://mems.isi.edu/mems.html 

Thanks to everyone who answered my questions regarding increasing
postscript output resolution for Ledit.  It seems that convertors are a
common thing, both home-made and commercial.  I haven't had a chance to
try all of these programsm but I've summarized those that were suggested
below.

The most common program suggested PostCIF/linkCAD.  PostCIF was a
shareware program developed by Daniel Gehriger, it has since been
commercialized under the product name linkCAD ($500).  Jason Cole was
kind
enough to pass my question along to Daniel Gehriger, who replied with
the following response concerning linkCAD's resolution: 

> The theoretical resolution is always 0.001 microns, or 25'400'000 dpi.
> 
> PostScript calculates in 72dpi units. To convert from nanomters to 1/72
> inches, LinkCAD tells the PostScript processor to multiply the units by
> 2.83464566929E-6. The calculation is done with very high precision and the
> actual limiting factor is the printer's resolution.
> 
> If the printer has a resolution of 4800 dpi, the minimum feature size and
> the maximum error would be approx. 5.29 microns. The annoying thing is when
> you have repeated structures (comb structures), alignment masks and so on.
> Because 1/4800 is not an integer multiple of 0.001 microns, you'll get an
> interference pattern, which will offset your structure by 5.29 microns at
> every wavelength.
> 
> >From the enclosed spreadsheet you'll find that the wavelength at 4800 dpi is
> roughly 84mm (depends on how you round,     this only gives an

> have a comb structure, you'll get nice digits (even though with an error of
> 5.29 microns) - but after approx 80mm you'll get an offset of one dot.
> Annoying. You'll say, no problem - 80mm is large enough. Correct, but you

Internet addresses for PostCIF and linkCAD are:

PostCIF-  http://dmtwww.epfl.ch/~dgehrige/postcif.html
linkCAD-  http://www.bay-technology.com/linkcad.htm

Another commercial program that was mentioned was LASI.  This one seems
to be one of the cheaper commercial ones around ($100).  It also
includes some CAD software for editing.

LASI-     http://www.engboi.uidaho.edu/lan-group/jbaker/wwwbook/book.htm

The next commercial program suggested was Xchange ($795).  Apparently it
works quite well.  A demo is available at:

Xchange-  http://www.neostech.com

A free program was written by Justin Mansell.  It is available at:

cif2ps-   http://www.wavefrontsciences.com  under the Micro-Optics
category

The last downloadable program was in perl code.  It was written by
Timothy Pfafman.  It can be found at:

perl code- http://micromachine.stanford.edu/~tep/software/cif2ps/

Several others offered to provide me with their own code if I could find
nothing else.  It seems there is no shortage of knowledge in this area.  
Other suggestions included using various graphics programs to read in 

Thank you's go out once again to all of those who sent responses.  I
hope this helps out some other people as well.

Hi, Chris,

Here are some notes which I did while working on the =
photolithography last time. Is it a raw text of course.=20
Hope you can place something on web.
Niyaz.

The text follows:
______________________________________

Some notes on the procedures of photolithography.

1. Turn on UV lamp.=20
-To do that: open AIR, VACUUM valves, turn on power ON on the right =
panel from the microscope.
-Turn timer on (right side).
-Turn lamp power ON on the left side.

2. Clean masks (might have some dust and dirt).
- Put aspen on, glasses on, gloves on.
- Place  masks into blue holders.
- Put masks into ACT for more then 1 minute, shake periodically. =
Use ACT clean, and baker for ACT clean.
- Wash masks with DI water.
- Blow with dry nitrogen to dry
- Bring masks over clean bench without talking.

3. Put mask into mask holder, push button VACUUM MASK on the right =
to keep mask on holder. Place mask holder with mask into aligner.

4. Put photoresist Shipley S1813 on wafer.
- Turn POWER on on the spinner. See =
http://thayer.dartmouth.edu/~microeng/equipment/spinner/spinner.html=

- Hit POWER RESET button.
- Voltmeter on.
- Use two buttons START, STOP to start and stop spinning.
- Put wafer and wafer holder in spinner and center them.
- Set T1, T2, f1, f2
- Spill photoresist while wafer rests. Use not more then half of =
glass tube.
- Hit START and wait until spinning stops.
- Transfer wafer onto hotplate at 120 C and bake for 3 minutes.
- Cool wafer for 3-5 minutes on cold wafer holder (clean before).

5. Meanwhile check UV LAMP intensity.
- remove any miscellaneous wafers
- Raise the lever.
- Hit button DS. Hit EXPOSURE.
- Intensity should rise to 26.4 mW/cm2. It is 20% more then was =
before, thus exposure time should be 20% less, i.e. 4 seconds =
(before was 6 seconds).

6. Align wafer.=20
- Focus on mask.
- Slide the mask aside.
- Bring wafer into sharp view and lower it by two turns
- Bring mask and wafer into "contact" and make final alignment.=20
- Bring wafer 3 turns up while checking that alignment remains =
intact.

7. Push EXPOSURE to exposure the wafer.

8. Developing.
- f1=3D600 for T1=3D54 s, f2 =3D 2000 for T2=3D60s
- spill evenly starting from the center while wafer is in rest
- wait  60 seconds
- hit START button
- wash with DI water while spinning on low.

WE were just about to try it when I wrote.
WE did have a problem with some rips in the photoresist both
near and well away from features, but I'm not sure of the
polish on the substrates (glass) the student was using.

Your exposure time is much longer than I'd have expected.
Even at 120C bake (that makes the resist much less sensitive and
requires longer exposures), we usually use more like 6 seconds.
What happens with the profile for shorter times?

We did the soak in the spinner (vented), but I'm not completely
happy with that either; would rather standardize on using the hood, 
perhaps with the hood light off.

Did you also find a working recipe for toluene?
--- end of quote ---

I purposely used a longer exposure to improve the undercut.  My goal was to
have the mask reproduced in the CB soaked layer.  Shorter exposures resulted in
less undercut (wider base, with about same overhang layer width).

I would not know what to expect when applying this CB soak recipe to a glass
substrate.  Any one or all of the paramters might need to be re-optimized.

Is it possible to get a small fume removal hood in the room next to or over the
spinner so that we can do CB soaks and such there?

I gave up on the tolulene soak, I did not have the time to pursue it at the
time.

Sometime soon I will be over to make some more devices.  Then, we will know for
sure how robust a recipe I came up with.

To all, 

Here is a summary of the answers I received concerning PDMS.  A big
THANK YOU to all those who helped!!!   Marvin

MY ORIGINAL POSTING:

Dear MEMS experts,
I am interested in using PDMS films for microfluidics, deposited onto
glass or sputtered SiO2.  My questions are:

1- PDMS is said to bond well to different materials, and to itself, so
that bonding can be conducted at very low temperatures. Is this true?
2- does the glass or SiO2 surface need treatment prior to PDMS
spin-coating to enhance adhesion?   If so, please describe a procedure.
3- how to change the wetting characteristics of the films?
4- how thick a single film of PDMS can be deposited practically without
cracking?
5- how to handle and dispose of this material?  is PDMS toxic?

Thank you.  Marvin Zai

Hello,

My name is Vincent Linder, PhD student working in collaboration with
several partner in Neuchatel and around (Switzerland). I'm actually
using Pdms, but I'm not experienced in film deposition of Pdms on
surfaces. Anyway, there are some hints that might help you:

Pdms binds to glass, silicium, plasitics, ... but the binding is
reversible.  Hence when Pdms is polymerized, you can peel it off the
surface (provided that the film is thick enough and the surface doesn't
have high aspect ratio structures). Pdms binding requires that both
surfaces are clean (dust free), no high tenperature are required.
Wetting properties are actually difficult to change, seems that plasma
treatement can produce hydrophilic surfaces, but these surfaces
undergoes reconstitution within hours or weeks. Pdms is not toxic (human
implent are made of some kind of Pdms), but must be handled with care to
avoid contamination of the monomers in lab.

Best regards,  Vincent Linder

Yes.  Adheres well at room temperature. A cured PDMS film aheres very
nicely
to clean SiO2.

I recall that brief exposure in an oxygen plasma enhanced adhesion for
cured
PDMS films. Since it is a siloxane anything that promotes a clean oxide
surface will enhance adhesion.

> 3- how to change the wetting characteristics of the films?
No direct knowledge on this. PMDS is rather viscous. It flows better at
higher temperature but of course cures faster.

> 4- how thick a single film of PDMS can be deposited practically without cracking?
I have made gaskets up to 20mm thick and 20mm high essentially by
pouring
the PDMS into a level mold and then letting gravity do the rest.

> 5- how to handle and dispose of this material?  is PDMS toxic?
Ask the manufacturer but I do not recall any particularly stringent
handling procedures.

**Marvin
**Answers below

1- PDMS is said to bond well to different materials, and to itself, so
   that bonding can be conducted at very low temperatures. Is this true?

**PDMS adheres very well to any surface containing silanol groups,
including glass and Si, by plasma oxidizing both surfaces prior to
bringing them into contact. Details in Duffy et al. Analytical Chemistry
1998, 70 (23), pp 4974-4984. 

2- does the glass or SiO2 surface need treatment prior to PDMS
spin-coating to enhance adhesion?  If so, please describe a procedure.
**again plasma oxidation migt help

3- how to change the wetting characteristics of the films?
**Details of changing surface chemistry are given in the Anal Chem paper

4- how thick a single film of PDMS can be deposited practically without
cracking?
**Details of spin coating are given in Jackman, Duffy, Cherniavskaya and
Whitesides in an article due to be published soon by Langmuir (March
30th I think)

5- how to handle and dispose of this material?  is PDMS toxic?
**Its very safe if a little messy.

**Hope this helps  **david,

Dear MEMS society,
Here are the replies I got untill now for recipes for isotropic glass etching:

REQUEST:

>Has any of you heard of /experience with Deep Reactive Ion Etching of

>We want to etch in the range 20-100 5m with vertical sidewalls.
>Which mask materials should be used ?
>Any comments and/or etch recipes are welcome !

ANSWERS:

Yes,  try Norsam, www.Norsam.com.  You can use photoresist as mask material.

I did some research on this and found from STS that the DRIE machine they
make is not capable of silica DRIE.

Please check www.triontech.com. Depending on thickness we may be able to offer
solution to you. Probably need He cooling for backside of wafer and proceed
with rather slow etch to keep temp cool. Bob Henderson 602-968-8818



CHF3 is often used for etching SiO2.
I have had good results using both nickel and chromium as masking materials
for deep plasma etch applications.  Aluminum can also be used but, but
unless it is sufficiently thick you may sputter it away before your etch is
complete.

My advice on this would be to add a very low flow of Oxygen. I have quite a
bit of expereince plaama etching oxide films, and very thick films are the
worst due to the polymer formation,redeposit situation. Typically a pure cf4
flow should not be a polymern issue, so this is a bit perplexing. The oxygen
consumes carbon in the reaction, keeping the critical carbon-fluorine ratio
outside the polymer formation point. The general rule of thumb for these
higher pressure RIE  (parallel plate) type processes is that if the c/f ratio
is 1/3 you are fine. If it goes to 1/2 you are on the edge. If the issue is
selectivity to an underlying Silicon layer you have to walk that tightrope,
but diampnd should have better selectivity-this I am guessing. The diamond is
a carbon film, but I have no idea whether the crystal structure would keep the
carbon constrained. Adding oxygen is not good for stopping on carbon,
obvioulsy. Alos, keep the flow very low, in your mix maybe 3 sccm or less. The
oxygen can be a sputtering enhancer, which would attack the aluminum, and
result in aluminum-oxide which will really deposit. Some competting reactions
and mechanisms here. With high pressure RIE, you are better off playing with
chemistries than trying to control the physical aspect of the etch.

Good luck

Hi,
the coefficients depend strongly on technology. Usually, K-factors are
given (relative change in resistance = K * strain). Here are some data:
p-Si: Kl = 25 (for NA = 10^19 cm-3)
      Kt = -5 (for NA = 10^19 cm-3)
n-Si: Kl = -25 (for NA = 10^19 cm-3)
      Kt = 3 (for NA = 10^20 cm-3)

Dear Memsers,

Here are the responses about 6" low-stres nitride coating service.  I was
looking for a US supplier, but thought that it'll be useful if all get to
know who can do it out there.

     Cornell (www.cnf.cornell.edu) is bringing the process up.
     Penn State (www.emprl.psu.edu) has a process with undefined stress
level.
     UC Santa Barbara (www.nanotech.ucsb.edu) has a PECVD process with
undefined stress level.
     MCNC (mems.mcnc.org) is currently qualifying their process.
     IMEC (www.imec.be) has wafer lines at 6" (upgrading to 8").
     IBMT (www.ibmt.fhg.de) has a PECVD process with defined (unspeicified)
stress.
     Polishing Company of America (www.pcasilicon.com) outsources: LPCVD @
1 GPa and PECVD @ -400 MPa.
     Virginia Semiconductor (www.virginiasemi.com) outsources: "high"
stress.

1000A Al is way too thin for good thermosonic bonding.  You may want to
try thermocompression bonding.  Also, you may want to deposit an
adhesion layer prior to Al deposition, such as TiW.

Call me if you need more help.

Dear Marvin

I'd like recommand that it would be better to increase the Al 
thickness(about
8000A).
and the temperature of wire bonder's hot plate will be 120 to 150 degree 
C.

hope to good result and your response, thank you a lot.

I feel your Al metal adhesion is not so good otherwise it would not have
come out from PZT. If  you can improve the adhesion I think you can work 
it
out. Also try to measure the Al thickness variation , it may not be 
1micron
across the bond pad. 

Prem



The problem is probably not the thickness of the Al layer, but the 
energy
absorbing PZT layer. 
If you can, use a structured layer of PZT and do your bond pads in a 
different
area.

Marvin,

Your best course of action is to "let the experts do it".  Contact at 
least
two wirebonder manufacturers and send them samples to try.  They may 
even do
it for free. If the experts can't do it, then you will need to change 
your
surface topology.  Run the aluminum off the PZT, and on to a more stable
surface such as your substrate. If this is not possible, perhaps a 
designed
experiment should be performed.  I can help with this if you need it.

Good luck and best regards,

Mike Mattes

You might talk with a wire bonder manufacturer such as Kulicke and Soffa 
in
Horsham PA, even if you don't use their bonder at this point.  They have 
been
doing wire bonding equipment since the 1960's, so they know quite abit 
about
the subject.

Photolithography Liftoff

using Shipley S-1813 positive resist with Toluene

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Photoresist Shipley S-1813 (positive) used together with Toluene as a
surface modifier to produce an undercut edge profile to ensure good liftoff.
(See the references below) This is similar to the well-known Chlorobenzene
process,
but it is using a non-chlorinated solvent so save the environment, following
the
EU 'substitution-rule' to phase out the usage of chlorinated substances
whenever possible.
 
(Last update: 971113)

     1. Clean substrate
     2. spin resist S-1813 @ 4000 rpm
     3. Soft bake,  90 C on hot plate for 1 min

Steps 4 - 6 in order to remove thick resist on edges of wafer

     4. Expose through edge removal mask, 10 mW/cm^2 for 30 sec
     5. Develop in MF322 for 20 sec
     6. Rinse in DI water

Steps 7 - 11 for pattern exposure

     7. Expose through pattern mask, 10 mW/cm^2 for 8 sec
     8. Soak in Toluene for 1 min
     9. Blow dry and drybake, 90C on hotplate for 15 s
     10. Develop in MF322 for 20-30 sec
     11. Rinse in DI water
     12. Blow dry.
     13. Ash at 50W 250mTorr Oxygen for 30 s

 
Comments:
 
Produces a nice undercut profile. To maintain the good edge profile, be
careful not to ash too strongly, and do NOT postbake.
 
The process above is used on YBCO with a gold cap layer. Exposure time
may have to be modified in accordance with the reflectivity of your
substrate material.
 
Toluene is a non-chlorinated solvent, which is better for the environment,
but it is still a dangerous chemical, possibly carcinogenic. Be careful.

Hello,
I'm trying to use the shipley electrodepositable photoresist PEPR 2400.
During first tests, I obtain a layer on my wafer, but when I want to dry it,
the photoresist seems to lose adherence and after 5 minutes there is only
dust of resist on it. 
Did anybody try such a resist, and had the same problem?
Thanks for suggestions or ideas.

1. It is SciTek 3130.  There could be other high resolution printers which
are routinely used by Offset printers in Bombay who cater to ad ajencies
to provide images in print.

2. Bromides is an option.  You can decide positive or negative while
firing.  The postscript file can be used to get either output.

3. If you specify SCREEN PRINTING then emulsion is down.
   If you specify OFFSET PRINTING then emulsion is up.

4. The film is TRANSPARENT to uv and the printed lines are NOT. We've
directly used it for lithography and got good results. 

Hope this info is useful.  

Regards,

-Ashutosh-

You could use IR printer which has a resolution of more than 10000 DPI. 
Offset Printers who make the master copy usually have this printing
facility. 

With this we at I.I.T. Bombay have been regularly using this technique for
mask making and getting reliable results upto 5 microns.

Wish you all the best.

Hi,

There has been some work done on it, that's for sure. Check:

"Anisotropic etching of z-cut quartz", by C. Hedlund, U. Lindberg, and J.
Svderkvist (J. Micromech. Microeng. 3, 65 (1993))

"Etch rates of Crystallographic Planes in Z-cut Quartz; Experiments and
Simulation", by P. Rangsten, C. Hedlund, I.V. Katardjiev, and Y. Bdcklund
(J. Micromech. Microeng. some of the 1997 or early 1998 issues)

There should be some more, but I don't seem to have the references here now.
Make a search on the names given above. Also, there should be references in
these papers.

They are still doing some quartz micromachining in Uppsala, as far as I
know. You could try contacting Pelle Rangsten
(pelle.rangsten@angstrom.uu.se) or Christer Hedlund
(christer.hedlund@angstrom.uu.se). I am sure they can give you a lot more
references.

Good luck!

Karin

Dear colleagues,

Now I am working on etching silicon wafer with KOH. I want to reduce the

thickness of silicon wafer to about 100 microns. But I found, after that

process
the surface of silicon became so worse that I could not continue my
work.

 Anyone can help me on  KOH etching techniques?
Thank you very much!

                                                              zhengwei

Hi!
I'm not sure if this helps.. but my colleague Jun Li
<jnli@seas.upenn.edu>
observed that if we start KOH etching from a polished face.. the surface

quality of the etched surface remains good for etches upto 200 micon
deep!
In short the end surface quality is dependant, inter alia, on the
starting
quality of that face.
Hope this helps.
Nilesh

There is evidence in the literature (J. Micormech Microeng. Vol 5 1995
209-218 S.A. Campbell et at.  "Inhibition of pyramid formation in the
etching of Si p<100> in aqueous potassium hydroxide-isopropanol") that
addition of IPA and saturation of oxygen allows etching with nm type RMS

surface roughness.

Do you need to use KOH?  Can you use an etch which is isotropic?  There
is
some evidence (specifically by Zarowin and the CMP process) that an
isotropic etch actually can improve the polish.  Try a mixture of nitric

acid, water, and buffered hydrofluoric acid.  I use 250:100:25 and get
about 0.5 microns per minute at room temperature.  The biggest "problem"
is
bubble formation.  If the etch is too fast (too much HF in my
configuration), bubbles mask the etch.

Hello Zhengwei,
If your intention is to reduce the thickness of Si wafers, you could (1)
use a mixture of HF + HNO3 + DIW, (2)
back-grind / CMP your wafers.

Jaideep

KOH tends to produce surface that is very rough. A company named SEZ
located
in Arizona has a tool for thinning wafers with a smooth surface.  They
use HF
and have a special way to wet process the backside of the wafer while
protecting the front side. They may have ability to provide you with
finished
wafers. I know of a company in San Jose that can do the same thing using
a
special lapping process if you are interested.  Bob Henderson
bobhendu@aol.com

Hi Zhengwei,

In order to prevent roughening of the Si surface during KOH etching add
to
KOH solution Isopropyl alcohol - IPA (if the volume of solution is 2l,
500ml of IPA will do)  which is the wetting etchant and removes the
bubbles from the wafer
surface during etching. You can also use megasonic sound or mechanical
stirring toremove the bubbles from the surface.

Regards,

Andrew Prochaska

Dear zhengwei,
After etching the silicon, VSI has found that a touch polishing for a
short amount of time works really well.

Zhengwei,

It is not a good idea to thin Si wafers with KOH due to its anisotropic
etch
of Si.  I am afraid that I can not provide any help on KOH etching.
However, I know of  one method of thinning wafers, that is, mechanical
grinding.  There are several commercial services in the United States
such
as Virginia semiconductor and Spin Technologies.  Yield is an issue
however
since 100 micron thick Si wafers are very fragile.

Good Luck,


Hi,zhengwei
   one of my co-worker forward your question about KOH to me.I do found
the starting surface affect the end result when i did KOH from polish
side of wafer. what is your test result? by the way. what kind of
research you are doing?
take care.
Jun

Hi,
Our laboratory is familiar with etching silicon wafer with KOH. We often
etch a single
crystal silicon to about 20~30um. The surface of silicon is very good
after etching.
The roughness is about 350A. The etching temperature is about 78C, and
the
concentration of KOH is about 40%. You may try it.
