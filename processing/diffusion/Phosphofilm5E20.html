<p align="center"><u>PHOSPHOROSILICAFILM 5 x 10<sup>20</u> </sup></p>

<p align="left">Phosphorosilicafilm is a dopant formulation designed to produce
phosphorous diffused layers in semiconductor wafers. Phosphorous diffused layers may be
produced routinely with sheet resistance profiles over the wafer surface flatter than
1-2%. Similar reproducibility from wafer to wafer and from run to run is easily achieved.
When applied by spinning or spraying, a film forms which consists of silica with
phosphorous dissolved in it. This phosphorous doped silica layer provides an erfc source,
and the sheet resistance decreases linearly with the square root of the diffusion time. <br>
<br>
Phosphorous concentrations required for emitters with high emitter efficiency in high
frequency transistors and integrated circuits are obtained with films about 2000 angstroms
thick. For high voltage devices requiring deep penetration and low sheet resistances less
than 1 ohm/square, sprayed-on films are used. <br>
<br>
Phosphorosilicafilm contains ethyl alcohol as solvent. In addition to ethyl alcohol,
methanol or isopropyl alcohol may be used as diluents if it is desired to dilute the
&quot;as-received&quot; formulation. <br>
<br>
Phosphorosilicafilm is hygroscopic and for extended storage, the container should be
securely fastened to prevent access of water vapor. The bottle may be left open for
reasonable periods of time with no deleterious effects. After films have been applied by
spinning or spraying, the wafers may be processed directly. However, if it is desired to
store the wafers for extended periods of time after film application and prior to
diffusion, the films should be hardened so that the layer is insoluble in water, and the
wafers may be stored with no loss in doping characteristics. If it is desired to
photo-etch Phosphorosilicafilm, higher temperature or longer heat soak is necessary for
good adhesion of the photo-resist and to prevent leaching of phosphorous from the glass
film. <br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Application</u> <br>
The viscosity of Phosphorosilicafilm is quite low, and the material wets readily to
silicon surface. Approximately 1-1.5 ml will cover a four-inch wafer. For shallow
penetrations where the source is not depleted, the sheet resistance obtained is
independent of spin speed. A spin speed should be selected which minimizes the lip which
builds up at the edge of the wafer. In 10 to 15 seconds of spinning, the film will be
formed. For spraying, the material should be diluted to yield a film less than 10,000
angstroms thick. A thicker film will develop cracks on drying. <br>
<br>
<u>Diffusion</u> <br>
Phosphorosilicafilm is useful for a wide variety of diffusion recipes.&nbsp; If you have
special requirements, Emulsitone can also adjust the glass/phosphorous concentration,
generating&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C<sub>0</sub>s from 1 x 10<sup>19</sup> to <br>
1 x 10<sup>21</sup>.&nbsp; Typical diffusion results with the standard material are
obtained as shown in the table following. <br>

<u>Surface Condition</u> <br>
Phosphorosilicafilm will yield no surface damage or deposits. The phosphorous doped silica
film is easily removed in dilute HF solution. <br>
