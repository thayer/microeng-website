<h1>RCA SC-2 Clean</h1>
The Standard Clean 2 (SC-2) solution of Hydrochloric acid and hydrogen
peroxide removes idual heavy metals, alkali ions, and metal hydroxides.
The most commonly used ratio is apparently 6:1:1; we use 4:1:1.
The reaction takes place at a temperature of 75C in
a teflon carrier within a fused quartz bath to avoid contamination from
ordinary glass.
