<h1>RCA SC-1 Clean</h1>
The Standard Clean 1 (SC-1) solution of Ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen
peroxide removes organic surface contamination.  The Amonium hydroxide serves as a solvating agent and as a complexant for metallic contaminants such as copper.
The hydrogen peroxide acts as a powerful solublizing oxidant.  
The most commonly used ratio is apparently 5:1:1; we use 4:1:1.
The reaction takes place at a temperature of 75C in 
a teflon carrier within a fused quartz bath to avoid contamination from
ordinary glass.
