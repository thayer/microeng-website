(SEM)</b><p>
<p>
	An electron microscope is an electron accelerator that focuses the electron
beam with the aid of electromagnetic lenses.  The accelerating voltage is
typically in the range of 60-100 keV.  The illumination source is a tungsten
filament, also known as the electron gun, which is heated to a high temperature
(2700deg.K) causing electrons to be released from the tip of the filament.
Lenses focus the electron beam and magnify the image after the electrons pass
through the specimen.  The lenses and the specimen stage are mounted in a
vertical, lead-lined cylindrical column that allows the interior to be
maintained under vacuum.  The vacuum is needed so that the electrons do not
collide with air molecules and get knocked off course before they reach the
specimen.  A good vacuum is required (10<sup>-7</sup> torr) since the mean free
path of an electron is 125 cm in a vacuum of 10<sup>-4</sup> torr.  <p>

	In the <i>scanning electron microscope</i> (SEM), a beam of accelerated
electrons is used to image surface features of specimens.  The surface
topography of a specimen is generated by the electrons reflected
(backscattered) or given off (secondary electrons) by a metal-coated (gold or
gold-palladium) specimen struck by the electron beam.  This is accomplished by
focusing a  narrow, intense beam of electrons to form a very small spot of
illumination (between 2&Aring; &amp; 200&Aring; diameter) on the specimen.
This fine spot is then moved sideways by deflecting the beam so that a very
narrow ribbon of specimen, whose width corresponds to the diameter of the spot,
is traversed by the electron probe spot.<p>

The probe spot is then returned very rapidly to a point on the specimen one
spot diameter above or below the original starting point, and the adjacent
ribbon of specimen is then traversed.  The process is repeated until the whole
area of the specimen has been covered by this "scanning" probe spot of
electrons.  The pattern of lines is called a raster, and is just like the ones
seen on the screen of a television set.  A visual image corresponding to the
signal produced by the interaction between the beam spot and the specimen at
each point along each scan line is simultaneously built up on  the face of a
cathode ray tube (CRT) in the same way as a television picture is generated
(Fig. 1).  The specimen image then appears in a similar way to the pictures
seen on a black &amp; white television screen.<p>

<b><u>Resolving Power in the Electron Microscope</u></b><p>
	The physical principles of optics and wave mechanics that define the operation
and limits of the light microscope apply as well to the electron microscope,
the major differences being the use of electromagnetic lenses instead of glass
and the wavelength of the light -- or more accurately, the <i>electromagnetic
radiation</i> -- illuminating the specimen.<p>
	The <i>resolving power</i> (R) of a lens is the ability of the optical (or
electromagnetic) lens to resolve two very close, but distinct, particles into
an image in which the particles are viewed as separate rather than one.
Resolving power is limited by the <i>wavelength</i> ([[lambda]]) of the
illumination and the <i>numerical aperature</i> (NA) of the light-gathering, or
<i>objective</i>, lens.  This relationship, defined by Ernst Abb&eacute;, can
be expressed mathematically as: R = 0.61 [[lambda]]/NA.  Thus, using an
objective lens with a numerical aperture of 1.4, the limit of resolution for a
light microscope using visible light ([[lambda]]avg = 550nm) is ~0.2 mm (or 200
nm).  The effective limit to useful magnification in a light microscope, in
turn, is roughly 1000-1500 times, beyond which point the limit of resolution
offsets the gain in information obtainable by magnification; that is, the
objects in view increase in size with increasing magnification, but appear as
one (large) particle rather than two distinct particles.<p>
	Electrons are charged particles that display the wave properties of
electromagnetic radiation.  According to de Broglie's equation, the wavelength
of an electron is inversely related to the speed (V) at which it travels:
[[lambda]] (nm) = 1.23/[[radical]]<i>V</i>.  The speed of electrons emitted by
a cathode (the <i>electron gun</i> in the EM) is directly related to the
potential (accelerating voltage) applied by the anode  to the beam of
electrons.  Electrons that have been accelerated by <i>V</i> volts have an
energy of <i>V</i> electron volts (eV).  Thus, the higher the accelerating
energy applied, the faster the electrons travel and the smaller the wavelength
of the electrons.<p>
