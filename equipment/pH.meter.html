<h3>Conditioning</h3>
Condition before use in storage solution or tap water fora  few minutes
to moisten and activate the pH electrode and to rinse of any white crystals.
<h3>Calibration</h3>
Periodic calibration is recommended, especially when the unit is used in acidic
or alkaline solutions or is
used often or when the batteries are changed.
<ul>
<li>Switch the unit on by a short pressing of ON/OFF key
<li>Then press and hold the ON/OFF switch for about 3 seconds.  The display will
start blinking "7.0 o" to confirm that you have entered the calibration procedure.
<li>Dip the unit in pH 7 solution.  Stir gently and wait about 20 seconds.  
(if Ec appears on the display, it means that the pH 7 solution is not fresh
or the electrode is not conditioned).
<li>The  micropHep automatically confirms the pH7 calibration after the sensor is accurately adjusted.  The display will blink "4.0 o" and after a few seconds
will show "Ec" to prompt you to use a second buffer solution.  If you are measuring pH in acidic liquids, use a pH 4 solution and for alkaline measurements, use a pH 10 solution.
<li>Rinse the unit in water and dip it in the second solution.  Alow approx. 20 seconds for the meter to autoconfirm the reading.  Once display stops blinking, it is calibrated.
<li>For one-point calibration, when the display starts blinking, dip the unit in pH 4, 7, or 10 buffer.  Wait 20 seconds for it to recognize the solution.  If you have used pH 4 or 10, it will automatically leave the calibration procedure and stop blinking.  If you have used pH 7 buffer, it will flash "4.0 o", waiting for a second buffer.  Simply switch the instrument off to leave the calibration procedure and back on to use it.
</ul>
<h3>Simple Maintenance:</h3>
Rinse the electrode with tap water after use.  To prolong the life of the electrode, place a small and clean sponge or tissu3e  in the bottom of the
cap, wet it with storage solution, pH 7, pH 4, or in the absence of these, tap
water, and replace the cap.  DO NOT USED DISTILLED (DEIONIZED) WATER FOR STORAG.
<h3>Changing the batteries:</h3>
If the batteries are lo, the unit will display the warning symbol "Eb".  Unscrew the four small screws on the back, remove cover, replace all 4 batteries, and recalibrate.
<h3>Error Messages</h3>
<ul>
<li>"Ec":  Wrong buffer:  Change the buffer solution; or unfit electrode: try cleaning then conditioning.
<li>"Eb":  Low battery
<li>"Er":  Over-Range:  Dry electrode.  Repeat conditioning.
</ul>
Note:  Strong fields may interfere with the microprocessor.  If the display remains fixed, remove one of the
batteries, wait 2 seconds, replace it and recalibrate.
