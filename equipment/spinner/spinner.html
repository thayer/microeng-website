Programming Instructions:
<ol>
<li> Press CHG/PRE
<li> Use +/- to scroll to desired recipe number
<li> Press ENT to accept number
<li> Press + to move to RPM 1, then ENT. 
<li> Set first spin speed in RPM using +/- followed by ENT
<li> Press + to move to RAMP 1, then ENT.
<li> Set ramp to first in seconds using +/- followed by ENT
<li> Press + to move to RAMP 1, then ENT.
<li> Set first spin speed in RPM using +/- followed by ENT
<li> Press + to move to TIME 1, then ENT.
<li> Set time to hold at first spin speed in seconds using +/- followed by ENT
<li> Press + to move to RPM 2, then ENT.
<li> continue as above to set speeds 2 and 3 as needed.  Set ramp 4 to 1 second.<li> Press MSG to get out of program mode.
</ol>
<p>
Running Instructions:
<ol>
<li> Verify that resist waste container under spinner bench is not full.
<li> Listen to ensure pressure air is on to purge spinner from any explosive solvent vapor.  Spinner will not power up if purge is absent.
<li> Check and/or change program (above).
<li> Turn off vacuum (manual green valve behind spinner)
<li> Mount sample.
<li> Turn on vacuum (manual green valve behind spinner...
<li> Vacuum indicator on Headway should come to black mark; if not, sample may not be set correctly or there may be a leak at the Headway spinner, or if no vacuum, also red valve on wall under bench may be off.
<li> Cover with snorkel.  Dispense through snorkel.
<li> Press START to initiate spin.
<li> After spin, turn off vacuum (manual green valve) and remove sample.
<li> Wash down bowl. If any  photoresist has entered spinner chuck vacuum hole, purge it and empty trap beaker on vacuum line behind the spinner.
</ol>

<ol>
<li>  Flip the power switch to the "on" position.

<li> Press the Power Reset button (note:  This button must be re-pressed any time the power has been interrupted.  ie.  Depression of the Emergency Stop button or opening the access door on the left hand side of cabinet).

<li> Place the vacuum switch on Auto (this turns the vacuum sample
hold off until the start button is pressed).

<li> Place holder and sample on vacuum chuck and center the sample.

<li> Verify centering:  
<ul>
<li>Turn dual speed controls to minimum, 
<li>Set first timer to 60s, and 
<li>Depress the Start button.  
<li>Listen for vacuum leak around sample, and adjust if necessary.  
<li>Slowly turn up first speed to a few RPM, and check sample for centering.
<li>Pss the stop button, and if necessary, reposition sample and repeat above until centered.
</ul> 
<li> Set the dual timers to the desired cycle times.

<li> Press the Start button.  While the chuck is spinning, adjust to the desired spinning speed for each part of the cycle, using calibration chart below.  (Speed 1 corresponds to Timer 1 and Speed 2 to Timer 2.)  Reduce time 1 to zero to proceed to timer 2.

<li> Set each timer to desired value (in seconds)

</ol>
note:  Speed 1 A is  a fine tune adjustment for Speed 1.
