<h2><center>HIGH TEMPERATURE TENSILE TESTING</h2>
<h3>USING THE THAYER SCHOOL INSTRON TENSILE TESTING MACHINE AND CENTORR VACUUM FURNACE
</h3></center>
<hr><strong>I  Preparation:</strong>
<i>(10 minute).</i>
<br>NOTE: when not actively driving the pull rods, leave the instron gear shift in neutral
<ol>
<li>Turn Instron Amplidyne and Main Power ON at the Instron control panel.
<li>Measure specimen and fill out Test Data Sheet.
<li>Mount specimen onto pull rods:
<ul>
	<li>Place specimen in grips.
	<li>Hang gripped specimen in top rod-mounts.
	<li>Place rod-mount onto top rod and push pin through.
	<li>Hang bottom rod-mount on bottom grips.
	<li>Put Instron into high gear (push lever away from you).
	<li>Use Up/Down toggle switch to move bottom rod into position.
	<li>Push bottom pin through.
</ul>
<li>Position safety cutoff limit switch stops  just past desired range of motion (this is IMPORTANT; see note below in section I)..
<li>Check Thermocouple position (it enters through hole on right of heat shiel)..
<li>Close and Seal (lightl). vacuum chamber.
<li>Open Air Valve (orange knob on fume hood).
<li>Open Water Valve (Right yellow handled lever on the wall next to the Vacuum Control Panel).
<li>Make sure Vacuum System Main Power is ON (circuit breaker on the wall).
<li>Turn ON the Control Panel Power and the Mechanical Pump (the fuse box next to the vacuum chamber).
</ol>

<hr><strong>II  Vacuum:</strong>
<i>(40 minute).</i>
<br>
NOTE:   The diffusion pump oil will burn ("crack). if exposed to air (oxyge). when it is hot.  Cleaning out and repairing the system after such an incident requires several messy days of labor.  The tungsten furnace elements are worth several thousand dollars and will also burn out if exposed to air when hot.     Think twice before you open a vent valve; the diffusion pump should be valved off and cool, and the chamber must be cool.  Whenever the diffusion pump is hot, foreline pumping is necessary to avoid pressure buildup; the foreline valve should be turned off only for brief intervals (5 minute)..  The foreline and roughing valves should never be open (o). at the same time (the mechanical pump should server as EITHER a roughing pump or a fore pump, not both at onc)..
<br><i>On the Vacuum Chamber Control Panel:</i>
<ol>
<li>Open the Mechanical Pump Relief Valve (switch u). to allow easy start of mechanical pump.
<li>Turn the Mechanical Pump (green light-up button).
<li>As soon as pump starts, close the Mechanical Pump Relief Valve (switch down).
<li>Open the Forline Valve (switch up).
<li>Turn on the Diffusion Pump (green light-up button).
<li>Wait 15 minutes for  diffusion pump to warm up.

<br><center><i>Roughing out the chamber:</i></center>
<li>Close foreline valve and open the rouging valve (switch down).
<li> Wait for pressure to fall below 4x10-2 torr (but not more than 5 minute).
<br>NOTE: if it takes longer, close the roughing valve, and open the foreline valve for a couple minutes, then close the foreline valve and open the roughing valve, and continue roughing out the chamber.
<li>Close the Roughing Valve (switch dow)., and open the foreline valve.
<br><center><i>Crossing over to high vacuum</i></center>
<li>Open the High Vacuum Valve (switch up).
<li>Allow 15-20 minutes to obtain vacuum under 8x10-5 torr.
</ul>

<hr><strong>III Tempreature and calibration</strong>
<i>(20-40 minutes, depending on temperatur).</i>
<ol>
<li>Set up chart recorder to thermocouple leads.
<li>Turn the Heat Zone on (green light-up button).
<li>Turn up the Variac Amperes until Chamber is at temperature.
<li>Allow chamber to stabilize for 15-20 minutes at temperature.
<li>Recalibrate and rezero the Instron:
<ul>
	<li>Use the zero knob to line up pen with the zero mark.
	<li>Turn the selector knob to 200 kg full scale.
	<li>Push the calibration button, and use the calibration knob to set it to 10 marks.
	<li>Recheck the zero, using the fine balance.
	<li>Adjust Selector knob to cover an appropriate range (usually 200 kg or 500 kg).
</ul>
<li>Tighten specimen in grips:
<ul>
	<li>Put Instron in high gear (away from you).
	<li>Using the Up/Down switch, slowly move bottom beam down until needle on the Instron Chart Recorder moves slightly.
</ul>
<li>Set the appropriate speed using the speed control buttons and the gear shift.
</ol>

<hr><strong>IV  Run the Tension Test</strong>
<i>(5 minutes to 3 hours, depending on spee).</i>
<br>
NOTE: Because you can not observe motion in the vacuum chamber, it is particularly important to have well set limit stops and not drive past them.  The furnace elements, rods, and heat shields were once destroyed when a student drove the rods back far enough to bend them into the side of the furnace.  She had no idea this had happened until she opened the furnace.

<hr><strong>V Cool Down and Return to Atmosphere</strong>
<i>(30-50 minute).</i>
<ol>
<li>If specimen is not fractured, use the Up/Down switch in high gear to return to zero.
<li>Go awhile after the recorder has reached zero to insure that the specimen will not tighten up after it has cooled down.
<li>Turn the Variac Amperes down to zero Amps.
<li>Turn the Heat Zone OFF (red button).
<li>Turn the Diffusion pump OFF (red button).
<br>Note:  If your specimen is extremely sensitive to atmosphere at your temperature, you may wish to wait until it has cooled down before turning off the diffusion pump.
<li>Turn the Quick Cool on (flip the "QC" switch up).
<li>Wait for 30 minutes for diffusion pump and vacuum chamber to cool down.
<li>Close the High Vacuum valve and the Forline valve (switch both down).
<li>Open the Mechanical Relief Valve (switch up).
<li>Turn the Mechanical Pump OFF (red button).
<li>When hiss stops, close the Mechanical Relief valve (switch down).
<li>THINK FIRST: are the diffusion pump and furnace cool?  Then open the vent (switch up).
 and allow chamber to come to atmospheric pressure.
<li>Close the vent (switch down).
<li>Open the vacuum chamber.
<li>Turn the Control Panel power fuse and the mechanical pump fuse OFF.
<li>Turn the Air supply and the water supply OFF.
<li>Turn the Instron Amplidyne and Main Power OFF.
</ol>
