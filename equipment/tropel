I just talked to a guy from technical support at Tropel, and they don't have
anything regarding old equipment anymore, they sold the last parts a couple of
months ago to a company in Pennsylvania ( Hoffman Materials). The actual
branch which produced these instruments was sold 15 years ago. Also, if we
want to bring the system up we need the calibration wedge, otherwise it is of
no use he told me.

I will try to track down Hoffman Materials over the weekend and call them up
on Monday.
