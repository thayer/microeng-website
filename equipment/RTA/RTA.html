Rapid Thermal Anneal (RTA) Processor
</center>
<br clear=both>
<p>
The AG Associates HEATPULSE 410 consists of
a heating chamber and a controller.
The wafer to be heated is placed on a quartz glass tray which slides into a
quartz glass tube in the oven.  Two banks of lamps, one above the tube
and one below it, provide the source of energy for heating the wafer.
The oven walls are covered with a reflective plating which decreases waste
heat, and enhances uniformity and ramp-up speed.
<a href="#operation">Operation instructions</a> are given below.
<p>
<h2>Specifications:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Steady-State Temperature Range:  400-1150C (Peak Temperature: 1350C)
<li>Steady-State Cycle Time:  1-300 sec (for longer times, use a
<a href="../furnace/furnace.html">diffusion furnace</a>)
<li>UHP Purge gas: oxygen, nitrogen, argon (or other noncorrosive gas)
<li>Wafer size:  3 inch
<li>Steady-State Temperature Stability +/- 7C
<li>Temperature Monitoring Mechanisms:
<ul>
<li>Above 800C:  Optical Pyrometer
<li>Below 800C:  Thermocouple
</ul>
<li>Heating Rate:  220 C/sec recommended (10-300 C/sec user controllable)
<li>Cooling Rate:  <=80 C/sec (temperature dependent)
<li>Radiant flux non=uniformity: <= +/-0.25%
<li>Nominal lamp life:  1000hr (21 lamps)
<li>Closed-loop temperature control
<li>Programmable time-temperature profiles
</ul>

<h2>Front Panel Operations</h2>
<ul>
<li>LED Readout--dependent on the METER SELECT KNOB, indicates
<ul>
<li>wafer temperature
<li>lamp current (upper or lower bank)
<li>lamp voltage (upper or lower bank)
</ul>
<li>Emissivity--Used to calibrate the optical pyrometer when the wafer back
surface emissivity changes.
<li>Manual Intensity--Control the heating lamp intensity when the system is
in manual mode.  The inside know controls the upper bank, and the
outside knob controls the lower bank.  Lamp intensity is displayed
on the LED in manual control.
<li>Power--ON/OFF switch
<li>Lamp Control--toggles between automatic and manual control of the chamber.
<li>Purge Flow Meter--Regulates the flow of the purge
gas into the quartz tube.
Calibrated for Nitrogen; full scale is 8 liters/min.  Calibration for other gas can be <a href="gas.calibration.html">calculated</a>.
<li>On/Off Indicator--green when power is being supplied to the system.
<li>Overheat Indicator--Red when system has been shut down as a resuld of
oven-wall overheating.
</ul>

<p><p>
<b>Start-up</b><p>
<b></b>1. Neslab: {on}.  50 - 60 psi, 1.5 gpm. House cooling valves: {both
off}. {Set temp} 20<sup>0 </sup>C.<p>
<p>
2. Check for water leaks around RTA, Neslab. <p>
<p>
3. Process gas (e.g Ar, O2, N2) main valves: {on}. 20 psi at bottle.<p>
<p>
4. Air valve (black): {on} (behind Keyboard, at right).<p>
<p>
5. Process Gas valve (green): {on} (behind Keyboard).<p>
<p>
6. Flow Gauge valve: {open} one and a half turns (left of Heating Chamber
door).<p>
<p>
7. Metering valve (black): {open} to 28 - 32 oz/in<sup>2</sup> (behind Heating
Chamber).<p>
<p>
8. Flow Gauge: 30 - 40 'mm'.  Note:  full scale is 8 liters/minute <p>
<p>
<b>Keyboard and Heating Chamber setting</b><p>
<b></b>1. Main 208V Safety Switch: {on} (at wall).<p>
.<p>
2. Keyboard Power Switch (white): {on} (behind Keyboard).<p>
<p>
3. Heating Chamber Power Switch (black): {on} (front panel of Heating
Chamber).<p>
<p>
4. {Type} any key on Keyboard to get to Main Menu.<p>
<p>
5. <u>Do not</u> place a wafer in Heating Chamber at this point. <p>
<p>
6. <b>Lamp Check: </b>{Select} "U". "Heatpulse" displayed. {Type} "Lamp-check"
and hit &lt;RETURN&gt;.<p>
<p>
7. <b>To Reach Main-Menu: </b>{Type} "Main", &lt;RETURN&gt;.<p>
<p>
8. <b>To Run a Diagnostic Test: </b>{Select} "D", display "Date=" {optional
type in},&lt;RETURN&gt;.<p>
	<p>
	"Operator = (optional) " hit &lt;RETURN&gt;.<p>
<p>
Next type Y for   a)  " Temp Diag Exec? Y/N "<p>
			   <p>
		         " Temp. Mont. Inst? Y/N "<p>
<p>
9. <b>To Run a Test on Wafer :</b> Example,  anneal it for 300s at 1100 C.
Place <p>
<p>
wafer on quartz pins in oven and lock door firmly. Select "S" from main menu,
should <p>
<p>
display   " Set A &lt;Time&gt;, T&lt;emp&gt;, M".<p>
<p>
Time: Select A, enter time(max 300s) and hit &lt;RETURN&gt; (goes to main
menu).<p>
<p>
Temp: Select "S" again, select "T" and enter temp(max 1250 C), hit
&lt;RETURN&gt;. <p>
<p>
Cycle execution: Type "A" in main menu. After the circulating water reaches
temp of 20 <p>
<p>
