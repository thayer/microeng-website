<P>The techniques of microfabrication and thin film deposition and analysis are fascinating and interrelated, but don't always fit together well to tell a single coherent story.  In this course, we weave these techniques together by studying the processes used in a series of example devices.  The applicability of this material is, of course, much broader than the particular examples we have chosen, and we will point out other applications and some limitations as we go. The true test of your understanding of this material lies in your ability to understand related techniques and to apply those we have studied in new ways.  You will have the opportunity to test this in the form of a literature research paper and a lab project of your choosing later in the term.</P>

Probable Outline:
<p>

<P>The five examples we will use to introduce techniques are multilayer coatings for optics, a surface micromachined motor, a bulk micromachined diaphragm, MOS transistors for microelectronics, and a semiconductor laser.  We will provide information on <I>process technology, equipment, and testing procedures</I> within these areas as follows.  In some cases we will cover the same technique twice, providing more detail the second time.</P>

</TABLE>
<B><P>GRADING:</P>
</B><P>The course will be graded on the basis of a student paper (and associated class presentation), a midterm, three preset labs, and a lab project.  The paper will be researched from the current literature on a topic agreed upon by the professors and the student, and will be 12-15 pages long (excluding references, etc).  

<!--The due dates associated with the paper are: topic selection- week of Oct 2, Extended outline-Oct. 9, Experimental section Oct 16, and the <B>completed paper is due October 23</B>.  Class presentations will be made immediately following the regular lecture portion of the course.</P>
-->

<P>The <B>exam</B> will cover the fundamentals discussed in lectures, and some material from the student presentations.  

<P>After we have covered most of the fundamentals in class, a major focus of the course wil be lab projects, to be completed by pairs of students, on topics chosen in collaboration with the faculty.  A<B> proposal</B> for this project, with a list of required materials, equipment, etc, <B>is due on Feb. 14</B>; discussions with the faculty should begin well ahead of this time.  

<P>The grade will be determined by the following weights:</P>
<B><P>10%</B> on the demo labs and tours</P>
<B><P>30% </B>on the paper</P>
<B><P>20%</B> on the midterm</P>
<B><P>40% </B>on the final lab project</P>

<P><u>The Honor Principle</u></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Homework/prescribed labs: You should only discuss general approaches to the problems, not specific answers. Cloned solutions will be considered a violation of the honor principle.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Exam:  The exam will be an in-class exam.  No notes or books will be permitted.  The questions must be answered without reference to any materials or persons; questions may be directed to the professors, who will visit the room during the exam. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>The paper requires you to pull together background information from a variety of sources, to use quotations and footnotes appropriately, and to write a bibliography.  Please review the booklet "SOURCES: their use and acknowledgement" to make sure that you do not fall into the trap of unwitting plagiarism.  If you have doubts about what needs to be acknowledged, and how, please come and see one of us early enough in the writing process that we can avert problems. Please not that photocopied figures need to be referenced, and that any material drawn from the web must be acknowledged by the full URL.  You are encouraged to utilize the expertise of the faculty, but all assistance should be footnoted and acknowledged.</P>

<P>For the lab project, all sources should be acknowledged in a handout accompanying the presentation.</P>
