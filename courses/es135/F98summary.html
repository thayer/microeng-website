<H1>		ENGS 135:   Thin Films and Microfabrication Technology</H1>
<p>
<u>ORC description:</u><p>
<u></u>	This course covers the processing aspects of semiconductor and thin
film devices.  Growth methods, metallization, doping, insulator deposition,
patterning, and analysis are covered.  There are two major projects associated
with the course -- an experimental investigation performed in an area related
to the student's research or interests, and a written and oral report on an
area of thin film or microfabrication technology.   Prerequisite: ENGS 24 or
equivalent.   Gibson and Levey.<p>
