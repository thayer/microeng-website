The associated techniques of microfabrication and thin film deposition play an important role in modern science and engineering, with applications ranging from thin film optical coatings to microelectronics and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  This course starts with theoretical and experimental background in the vapor deposition of thin films, and characterization of such films for optical, electrical, and mechanical applications.  We next consider how such films can be patterned to form integrated systems of very small parts.  We take a MEMS micromotor, a pressure sensor, and CMOS transistors as case studies.   We then fill out the toolbox of microfabrication processing techniques with additional growth, deposition, doping, and etching techniques, and provide design experience using a microfabrication layout editor (L-Edit).   We also compare top-down approaches (such as photolithographic patterning) to bottom-up approaches (such as self-assembling structures), and we consider the implication of scaling laws on effective microsystem design.  The course will include field trips to industrial thin film and MEMS fabrication facilities.
<p>
Course assignments will include:  reading, lab work and reports, two student paper/presentations, a layout design project, homework, and quizzes.

Prerequisite:  ENGS 24 (Materials Science), equivalent, or consent of instructor.

The Honor Principle
<br>
Quizzes: The quizzes will be open book and open notes, but there will be a time limit. You may not discuss the content of the quizzes with any other person until after the quiz is no longer available.
<br>
The paper requires you to pull together background information from a variety of sources, to use quotations and footnotes appropriately, and to write a bibliography. Please make sure that you do not fall into the trap of unwitting plagiarism. If you have doubts about what needs to be acknowledged, and how, please come and see one of us early enough in the writing process that we can avert problems. Please note that photocopied figures need to be referenced, and that any material drawn from the web must be acknowledged by the full URL. You are encouraged to utilize the expertise of the faculty, but all assistance should be footnoted and acknowledged.

<h2>Microfabrication (Prof. Levey)</h2>
<p>
The first half of the course concerns thin films, and stacks of such films
of various thicknesses, i.e.  a pattern in the vertical dimension.  
We now expand our design space to include patterning in lateral dimensions
to create integrated systems of very small parts (ICs and MEMS).   We motivate
and organize discussion of the fabrication techniques required by looking at
the steps required to make a surface micromachined motor, a MEMS pressure 
sensor,  and a MOS transistor.
