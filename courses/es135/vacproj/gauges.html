	Andrei Burnin, Jiying Li, and I worked together to check the vacuum gauges.  Overall, all external wires passed testing with a volt meter.  The two low-vacuum gauges, and one ion gauge, were placed in a known working CMK III system (Room 20), and were found to work properly.  It should be noted that the ion gauge wire has sustained some heat damage, but interior insulation remains intact.  A little electric tape wrapped around the affected length is appropriate to fix the problem.  The vacuum meter instrument is having problems.  The two low-vacuum meters are functioning, but the high-vacuum meter is inactive.  When the start button is pushed to turn on the ion gauge, nothing happens.  The filament will not light.  The box is now in the shop across campus in hopes of fixing what is presumed to be an electrical malfunction.  Once fixed, a final calibration against a trusted meter is recommended to ensure accurate vacuum readings
