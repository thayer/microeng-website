<h2><a name="def">Definition</a></h2><p>
</b><p>
	The idea used is that a gas flow exerts a pressure (force) on 	any object
which lies in its path. This mechanical force is 	utilized to cause change in
position of a moveable part of the 	device. This change in position causes an
electrical change to 	take place in the system. This electrical change is
easier to 	measure than the gas flow per se.<p>
<h2><b><p>
Problem Statement<p>
</b></h2><p>
	To measure a significant capacitance change<b><p>
</b><p>
<p>
The <b>aims</b> of the capacitive micro flow-sensor are:<p><ol>
	<li>To detect the presence of gas flow<p>
	<li>To measure the rate of a small gas flow if it exists</ol><b><p>
</b><p>
<p>
Components of the device:<p><ol>
		<li>Rotating beam<p>
		<li><A HREF= hinge.GIF> Sail</A>  hinged to polysilicon beam at one end<p>
		<li>Angular <A HREF = electrodes1.GIF> comb capacitor electrodes</A> attached to other 		     end of beam<p>
		<li><A HREF= spring.GIF> Springs (2)</A><p>
		<li>Damping<A HREF = coil.GIF> coil</A><p>
			<li>Connection<A HREF = pad.GIF> pads</A></ol>

<h2><b><p>
<a name="princ">Working principle of device:</a><p>
</b></h2><p><ul>
	<li>Sail moves with force of flow thus moving moveable capacitor 	in and out of
fixed capacitor<p>
<p>
	<li>There is a change in capacitance for a degree change in area of 	overlap
between electrode fingers<p>
<p>
	<li>Springs return the beam to its original position<p>
<p>
	<li>Damping coil damps out the oscillation of the beam caused by 	the
springs</ul><h2><b><p>
<a name="det">Design Details</a></b></h2><p>
<p><ul>
	<li>Rotating poly1 beam of maximum length of 200 microns. This 	is to avoid
bending or breaking of the beam. <p>
<p>
	<li>Sail of Poly1 attached to beam by poly2 hinges<p><ul>
			<li>sail raised out of plane after release<p>
			<li>kept in vertical plane by means of a hinge<p>
			<li>for greater efficiency, sail is perforated </ul><p>
<p>
	<li>The hinge has poly2 staples that are anchored to the beam.<p>
		When the sail is raised after release, the central poly1 and 2 	connection
rotates into the vertical plane to be stapled down. 	The sail does not release
down onto the substrate. The hinge 	stands on three legs for stability<p>
<p>
	<li>Poly2 springs are attached to beam on both sides. The stiffness 	of the
spring can be controlled by its design structure.<p>
		Two springs were used, on either side of the beam, to help 	stabilize the
structure.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<li>The damping coil has to be placed under the beam so that it 	can produce
eddy currents in the beam which can damp 		its motion<p>
<p>
<p>
	<li>The moveable poly1 bi-directional rotary comb electrodes were 	anchored to
the beam.<p>
		Dimensions to be considered included height, air gap and 	length of
electrodes.<p>
		Efficiency dependence was placed on more electrodes, more 	overlap and thus
more sensitivity in capacitance readings.<p>
		The fixed plate were anchored to the silicon substrate.</ul><p>

<h2><b><p>
<a name="cal">Calculations</a><p></h2>
</b><p>
	Some of the constants to be taken into consideration included<ol>
		<li>density
		<li>pressure
		<li>spring constant</ol><p>
	Some of the variable were:<ol>
		<li>area of sail		<li>weight of sail
		<li>weight of beam	<li>weight of electrodes
		<li>area of overlap of electrodes</ol><h2><b><p>
Design Iterations</b></h2><p>
<p><ul>
	<li>With different sail dimensions<p>
	<li>With different beam lengths    </ul><p>
<h3><b><p>
Notes:</b></h3><p>
<p><ul>
	<li>For accuracy, reading of two capacitance signals may be  	 	 preferable
<p>
	<p>
	<li>Overall design<p><ul>
			<li>cover sensor with plastic tubing to direct flow and 		   protect circuitry
<p>
			<li>use device for uni-directional flow sensing</ul></ul><p>

<h2><b><p>
<a name="fin">Final design<a/><p>
<p>
	</b></h2>This included some dimples to prevent stiction on the beam.<p>
	On one of the designs<A HREF=flowsensor1.GIF> (see fig.)</A>, the <A HREF =hub.GIF> hub</A> was moved closer to the electrodes for greater
radius of rotation of the beam. This was due to the fact that the final comb
electrodes design was much smaller than the beam which meant that it had a
small radius of curvature.<p>
Due to <A HREF="http://www.mcnc.org/HTML/ETD/MEMS/mumps.html"> MUMPs </A>design rules, design iterations could not be included.<h2><b><p>
<p>
Conclusion</b></h2><p>
<p>
	Although the final design was completed many of the anticipated calculations
and design aspects could not be incorporated and achieved on time.<p>
	<p>
	<h3><b>Design review</b></h3><p>
<p><ul>
	<li>Completion of calculations necessary to capacitance 	measurements<b><p>
	<li></b>Design consideration for hinge stability in the vertical plane 	thus
considering greater gas pressure tolerance of sensor<p>
		At present, the hinge may not be stable in the vertical plane 	and a small
pressure may blow the sail down<p>
	<li>A greater radius of curvature for the comb electrodes so as to 	have the.hub
centered on the beam.<p>
		This would lead to greater sensitivity and larger capacitance 	readings<p>
	<li>More flexibility in the springs so as to have greater motion of 	the beam</ul><p>
