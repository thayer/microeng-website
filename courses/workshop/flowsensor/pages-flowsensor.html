</b><p>
The aims of the gas flow microsensor are:<p>
(1) Detect the presence of a flow<p>
(2) Measure the rate of small gas flows if it exists<p>
<p>
The idea used is that a gas flow exerts a pressure (force) on any object which
lies in its path. This mechanical force is utilized to cause change in position
of a moveable part of the device. This change in position causes an electrical
change to take place in the system. This electrical change is easier to measure
than the gas flow per se.<p>
<p>
Components of the device:<p>
(1) Beam<p>
(2) Sail<p>
(3) Rotary capacitors<p>
(4) Springs (2)<p>
(5) Damping coil<p>
(6) Connection pads<p>
  <p>
Working principle of device:<p>
	<p>
(1) Sail moves with force of flow thus moving moveable capacitor in and out of
fixed capacitor<p>
<p>
(2) There is a change in capacitance for a degree change in area of overlap
between electrode fingers<p>
<p>
(3) Springs return the beam to its original position<p>
<p>
(4) Damping coil damps out the oscillation of the beam caused by the springs<p>
<p>
Design Details<p>
<p>
(1) Rotating Poly1 beam of maximum length of 200 microns. This is to avoid
bending or breaking of the beam. <p>
<p>
(2) Sail of Poly1 attached to beam by Poly2 hinges<p>
		   - sail raised out of plane after release<p>
		     - kept in vertical plane by means of "hook" <p>
		     - for greater efficiency, sail is perforated <p>
	<p>
(3) Poly2 springs are attached to beam on both sides. The stiffness of the
spring can be controlled by its design structure.<p>
<p>
(4) The damping coil has to be placed under the beam so that it can produce
eddy currents in the beam which can damp its motion		<p>
 Design Iterations<p>
(1) With different sail dimensions<p>
(2) With different beam lenghts    <p>
	<p>
Notes:<p>
<p>
(1) For accuracy reading of two capacitance signals may be preferable			<p>
	<p>
(2) Overall design<p>
			- cover sensor with plastic tubing to direct flow and 		   protect circutry
<p>
			- use device for uni-directional flow sensing
