   Simone and I did the same artcle so she did the write up for both of us.  If
this is a problem, let me know. The July 7 journal club is the one I am
referring to in this letter.

My most recent article came from the International Journal of Radiation,
Oncology, Biology, and Physics entitled "Evaluation of an ingestible telemetric
temperature sensor for deep hyperthermia applications".  This article discussed
the use of a temperature sensitive quartz crystal to monitor temperatures in
regions of the body where heat is being applied to treat tumors.  The device
known as a radio pill is 2cm in length and icm in diameter and as such is
unable to treat areas where it would have to pass through the blood stream. The
functioning of the device can be deduced from its nomenclature.  The device
contains a temperature sensitive crystal which is coupled to an inductor.  This
circuit, powered by a siver oxide battery, functions like a L.R.C. circuit
producing radio waves as it oscillates.  The output signal is detected by a
receiver outside of the body.  Several factors, such as, elctrmagnetic
interference, ionizing radiation doses were studied to test the efficiency of
the crystal.  Future work for the device would be centered around the
decreasing the size of the device and on improving the accuracy of its results
which, up to that time, fell below theH.P.C.'s alllowed experimental error
0.2%.

Dr. Levey:

	On June 30 I had discussed the following paper: Flexible, Dry-Released
Process for Aluminum Electrostatic Actuators by Christopher W. Storment, David
A. Borkholder, Victor Westerlind, John W. Suh, Nadim I. Maluf, Gregory T. A.
Kovacs. It appeared in the Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Vol 3,
No. 3, September 1994.

	On July 7 I had discussed the following paper: A Computer-Aided Design
System for Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMCAD) by Stephen D. Senturia,
Robert M. Harris, Brian P. Johnson, Songmin Kim, Kieth Nabors, Matthew A.
Shulman, Jacob K. White. It appeared in the Journal of Microelectromechanical
Systems, Vol 1, No. 1, March 1992.

  Title: Metallic Microstructures  Fabricated Using Photosensitive Polyimide
Electroplating molds

	Authors:  A. Bruno Frazier and Mark G. Allen, member, IEEE

	Source:  Journal of Microelectromechanical systems, Vol 2, No 2, June
1993

	Comments:  This article discusses the use of photosensitive polyimide
electroplating molds in the fabrication of metallic microstructures (eg.
microactuators or micromotors)

	This article outlines the basic process which illuminates the
advantages of using Photosensitve polyimide electroplaing molds in comparison
with the LIGA process.  I chose this particular article because it outlines a
process  similar to the one we are using in our exploration of micromachine
technology.
