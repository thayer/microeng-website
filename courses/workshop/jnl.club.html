Title:  SEMATECH Minienvironment Benchmarking Project
Journal:   Journal of the IES (Institute of Environmental Sciences).
May/June 1995, PAGES:  36-42
</pre>
   SEMATECH did an experiment comparing clean labs to minienvironment
facilities.  The test was extensive and covered many factors including air
velocity and aerosol tests.  It was found that silicon wafers left in the
minienvironment were approximately 1,000 times cleaner than those wafers just
left in the class-1 lab itself.

Title: A Micromachined Silicon Sieve Electrode for Nerve Regeneration
Applications
Authors: Tayfun Akin, Khalil Najafi, Richard H. Smoke, and Robert M. Bradley
Journal: IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering
Volume: 41 No. 4, April 1994, Pages: 305-313
</pre>
The article describes the microfabrication and testing of a silicon electrode
for use in nerve regeneration applications.  The electrode contains a thin
diaphragm with various size through-holes which allow regeneration of
individual axons of varying diameters.  Recording/stimulating sites surround
the holes and allow long-term recording and stimulation of axons.  The
fabrication-process is single-sided, requires five masks, and is compatible
with integrated multilead silicon ribbon clabes for CMOS circuit compatibility.

Title:  "Micromachined Detectors for an enzyme-based F.I.A."
Journal:  Journal Of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, 1993, volume 41.
Authors:  M. Suda, T.  Sakuhara, Y. Murakami and I. Karube.
</pre>
This article was entitled
"Micromachined Detectors for an enzyme-based F.I.A."
by four Japanese scientists
M. Suda, T.  Sakuhara, Y. Murakami and I. Karube.
This article was about the use of
micromachining technology in the fabrication of Biosensors.  In partciular the
article discussed the development of an electrochemcial flow cell used in
liquid chromatography(flow injection analysis) intoa biosensor.  This was
achieve by attaching an enzyme immobilised column to the flow cell.  This
column was made by anisotropically etching silicon and served to fix the
position of the enzyme, such that, when the particular subsrtae (such as
glucose) was injected into the column the enzyme would reduce the molecular
structure to an ionic one making the substrate conductive in aqueous solution.
The substrate was consequently detected by the microcurrent it produced in
solution.  For future processes, the substrate injector and plunge pump would
be manufactured using micromachinig techniques.
This article was found under medline using micromach as a search word.

Title: A Method to Etch Undoped Silicon Cantilever Beams
Authors: Wai-shing Choi, Jan G. Smits
Publication: Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Vol. 2., No. 2., Pages
82-86.
Date: June 1993

</pre>
The article outlines a method of fabricating silicon cantilever beams
oriented in the <100> direction by etching (100) silicon wafers.  The scheme
uses two masks.  Anisotropic etching is performed in sodium hydroxide to
produce cantilevers with background doping concentration levels and vertical
edges.  This method is presented as an alternative to those which use
back-etching, heavily doped boron etch stops, or anodic oxidation etch stops.

Title:    Evaluation of an ingestible telemetric temperature sensor
          for deep hyperthermia application
Source:   International Journal of Radiation,
          Oncology, Biology, and Physics

</pre>
My most recent article came from the International Journal of Radiation,
Oncology, Biology, and Physics entitled "Evaluation of an ingestible telemetric
temperature sensor for deep hyperthermia applications".  This article discussed
the use of a temperature sensitive quartz crystal to monitor temperatures in
regions of the body where heat is being applied to treat tumors.  The device
known as a radio pill is 2cm in length and icm in diameter and as such is
unable to treat areas where it would have to pass through the blood stream. The
functioning of the device can be deduced from its nomenclature.  The device
contains a temperature sensitive crystal which is coupled to an inductor.  This
circuit, powered by a siver oxide battery, functions like a L.R.C. circuit
producing radio waves as it oscillates.  The output signal is detected by a
receiver outside of the body.  Several factors, such as, elctrmagnetic
interference, ionizing radiation doses were studied to test the efficiency of
the crystal.  Future work for the device would be centered around the
decreasing the size of the device and on improving the accuracy of its results
which, up to that time, fell below theH.P.C.'s alllowed experimental error
0.2%.

Title: Metallic Microstructures  Fabricated Using Photosensitive Polyimide
       Electroplating molds
Authors:  A. Bruno Frazier and Mark G. Allen, member, IEEE
Source:  Journal of Microelectromechanical systems, Vol 2, No 2, June 1993
</pre>
Comments:  This article discusses the use of photosensitive polyimide
electroplating molds in the fabrication of metallic microstructures (eg.
microactuators or micromotors)
<br>
	This article outlines the basic process which illuminates the
advantages of using Photosensitve polyimide electroplaing molds in comparison
with the LIGA process.  I chose this particular article because it outlines a
process  similar to the one we are using in our exploration of micromachine
technology.

</pre>
        Engineers at the University of California (Los Angeles) and the
California Institute of Technology (Pasadena) have developed and are
fine-tuning a micromotor that is to be added to the read-write head of future
personal computers.  This device, which moves the head through a range of 20
microns above the data disk, is capable of vastly increasing the information
capacity of modern magnetic data storage systems.

Title:  " A Fiber-Optic Carbon Dioxide Sensor for Fermentation Monitoring"
Source:
</pre>
This fiber-optic chemical sensor was developed for determining dissolved carbon
dioxide and assessing its performance for on-line monitoring of fermentation.
The sensor operates on the Severinghaus pCO2 electrode principle; it consists
of a pH sensitive dye in an HCO3- buffer solution entrapped in an expanded PTFE
support head at the distal end of an optical  fiber by a gas permeable
membrane.  CO2 crossing the membrane produces a pH change in the indicator
solution.
<p>
On-line monitoring is important, not only for control strategies but for
providing a greater insight into the dynamics of the bio-reactions that
regulate production.
<p>
This paper was insightful in displaying a simple and inexpensive sensor that
can be used economically in the fermentation process.

Title:  Effects of <110> oriented corner compensation structures on membrane
quality and convex corner integrity in <100> silicon using aqueous KOH.
Authors: R.P. van Kampen and R.F. Wolffenbuttel
</pre>
   This article was about the adding of compensation structures in an effort to
preserve the shape of convex corners when using a KOH etch.  Experiments showed
that the <411> plane was responsible for the under-etching of these structures
and that a clean top to bottom compensation structure is not possible.  The
compensation structures used were in the <100> and <110> directions.  It is
also shown that the compensation structures leave ridges on the wanted
structure which can not be removed with further etching.

Title: Silicon sensors with integral tips for atomic force microscopy: a novel
single-mask fabrication
Authors: M M Farooqui and A G R Evans
University of Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, UK
Journal: Journal of Micromechanics and Microengineering Stuctures, Devices and
Systems
Location: Vol. 3, No.1, March 1993, Pgs 8-12
</pre>
Content: The paper describes a single-mask process for fabrication of silicon
microcantilevers with integral silicon tips for use in atomic force microscopy
(AFM).  The tips have radii of a few nanometers.   The process eliminates
alignment errors introduced while using more than one mask so that the silicon
tips are located precisely on the central axis of the cantilevers.  The central
location of the tip prevents twisting of the cantilever and distortion of
topographic images while performing microscopy using reflected laser beam
technology.

Title: Fabrication and testing of a microdynamic rotor for blood flow
 measurements.
Source: Micromech. Microeng. 1(1991)60-65
Authors: Rapoport, Reed and Weiss
</pre>
Abstract: The purpose was to design  and fabricate an in vivo flow sensor to
measure blood velocity in coronary arteries( to determine Angiopasty). A
three-silicon-layer process, in which the the  rotor turns between the
substrate and a semicircular cap, was developed to fabricate the microdynamic
device. Repeatable rotation rates in flowing fluids were obtained, and
qualitative observations concerning operation of the device in blood were
noted. The article also proposed the use of a magnetoresistive sensing element
as a non-contacting coupling technique.

Title: Application of porous silicon as a sacrificial layer
Journal:  Sensors and Actuators A, 43 (1994) Pgs. 239-242
Authors: W. Lang, P. Steiner, A. Richter, K. Marusczyk, G. Weinmann and G.
Sandmaier
</pre>
Content: Free standing structures can be realized using anisotropic etching in
KOH, surface micromaching sacrificial layer (silicon oxide) methods, or porous
silicon technology.  The article describes how porous silicon can be used as a
sacrificial layer in surface micromaching processes to produce large distances
(= 100 $B5m) from the structure to the substrate. The application of this
process for making free standing polysilicon bridges and flow channels in doped
p-silicon wafers is described.

Title: "Fluorescence assay for measuring lipid deposits on contact lens surfaces"
Source:
</pre>
A simple fluorescence assay was developed for estimating the propensity of a
contact lens surface towards the uptake of lipids and formation of lipid
deposits.  The assay is based on the incubation of the contact lenses with an
artifical tear-lipid mixture, staining of the lenses with a fluorescent lipid
probe, Nile Red, and subsequent macroscopic imaging fluorescent lipid deposits
on the contact lens surface with a thermoelectrically cooled charge-coupled
device (CCD) camera.
<p>
This new method of estimating the sorption of lipids is perhaps a  more
economical way of preventing spoilation on contact lenses.  Due to the advent
of "soft" contact lenses, spoilation has become the major  ocular compatibility
problem due to extended wear capabilities of the lenses.
 The fluorescence assay is a way to detect the presence of lipid deposition
before too much ocular damage is done.
