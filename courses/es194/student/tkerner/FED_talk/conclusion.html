<title> V.   Conclusion to Field-Emitter Display Talk </title>
<H2>
<DT> <A NAME = "summary"> A. Summary  </A> </H2>
   <DL> <H3>
  <DT>  1.  Vacuum Tubes, Semiconduct. Transistors,  Microfab. Integrated Circuits
        <DL>
             <DT>  a.  General progression in electronics but tubes still superior in displays 
              <DT>  b.  FED combines best of CRT's and microfabricated FPD's <A HREF = "sources.html#1"> #1 </A>
        <DL>
            <DT>  1)  High image 	quality afforded by phosphors
            <DT>  2)  Microfabrication allows flat, lightweight, low-power
            <DT>  3)   Brighter, wider viewing angle, more efficient than AMLCD's <P> <img src = "fedcompa.gif"> <P>

            <DT>  4)   Elimination of bulky deflection coils, inefficient optical filters       
                 <DT>  5)  Simple, redundant design should decrease cost/increase yield
                 <DT>  6) DFED's should have very lowest manufacturing costs
       </DL> 
   </DL> <P> 

   <DT>  2.  Key to FED is the cold micro-cathode (FEA's)
           <DL>
             <DT>  a.  Field-emission not thermionic emission
             <DT>  b.  Can microfabricate metal or silicon tips
             <DT>  c.  Can use diamond film as well
             <DT>  d.  Uniformity of  microcathodes over LARGE surface is key
             <DT>  e.   Size limited: hard to cover LARGE area with identical sharp tips 
          </DL>
<P>

<H2> <DT> <A NAME = "currfut"> B. The Current and Future for FED's   </A> </H2>  <DL><H3>
  <DT> 1.  AMLCD's still dominates (96% made in Japan) <A HREF = "sources.html#1"> #1 </A>
   <DT> 2.  When FED's  perfected, they should takeover since superior
   <DT>  3.  FED's may redeem struggling U.S.  display technology
    <DT> 4.  Many U.S. companies now vigorously developing FED's: <P>
