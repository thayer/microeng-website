Flat Panel Display Technology:  Field Emitter Displays  - OUTLINE			

I.   Introduction to Field-Emitter Displays (FED's)
     A.  Although many people have developed different flat panel displays (FPD's),
           liquid crystal displays (LCD's), plasma displays (PD's), and electroluminescent
           displays (ELD's), these all are inferior compared to the cathode-ray tube (CRT) 
           in terms of image quality, brightness, viewing angle, maximal viewing size[2, 143]
     B.  The CRT is bulky and requires a lot of electric power to operate
     C.  Current flat panel displays are dominated by active matrix LCD technology, but
           there are major disadvantages to AMLCD's:
               1.  Difficult to fabricate
               2.  Size Limitation
               3.  Limited Viewing Angle 
               4   Power Hungry - back light always on even when dark screen; polarized
                    filters only let 1/2 light intensity through.
               5.  Very High Capital Investment
               6.  High Production Cost
     D.  Hence there is a big quest to make flat-panel CRT displays 
     E.  New catholuminescent flat-panel display based on field-emitter arrays (FEA's)
           has been recently developed - Field Emission Display (FED)
           1.  Basic concept of matrix catholuminescent display from U.S. Army research
                at SRI in the 1960's (Spindt, IEEE 1989)

II.   How FED's work: 
     A.  Overall:
           Like the conventional CRT, the FED's has electron beams illuminating phosphors
           comprising pixels which form an image.  The big difference is the way the FED 
           generates the electron
           beam.   Instead of having a single electron beam generated by a hot cathode
           filament at the back of a bulky long tube lined with deflection coils and plates, the 
           FED has a flat  array of thousands of microfabricated tips which generate electron
           beams behind each pixel.  The electron beams need not be steered, but merely
           turned on or off at each pixel.  A typical panel is 4 mm thick (Spindt, IEEE 1989).

     B.  Principle of Electron Emission:
           1.  Electrons in a solid have many energy levels, all equal to or below the Fermi
                Energy.

           2.  For a given material in a vacuum,  applying thermal energy, light, E field, etc. 
                so electrons are given an energy that exceeds the work function W,  causes 
                electrons to be emitted from the surface of the material into a vacuum:

                (Lecture Notes #6, page 11)
                Typically the work function ranges from 1eV to 5.6eV (Petrenko, ENGS 163)
                Conduction electrons are particles confined inside a potential energy box with
                finite height sides.  The conduction electrons fill a myriad of energy states, and
                the highest state is called the Fermi energy at T = 0.

                The workfunction is the minimum energy required to remove an electron in a
                vacuum. 

                PICTURES (2):

           3.  Traditionally, the thermionic cathode is a very hot filament.  The Fermi 
                Energy increases from the high thermal energy, and electrons can over
                come the workfunction and hence be emitted.  A high voltage 
                between the cathode and an accelerating grid and a final target cause
                electrons to readily bombard the target: F = eE. Very high voltages are required
                to efffect this situation (1 to 30 kV).  The final target is a fluorescent screen
                with red, green, and blue phosphors.  The electrons excite the electrons in these
                molecules (ZnS, ZnO, etc) and when the electrons resettle, they emit light.
                The beam is moved with electric and (F = eE and F = eB X v) 
                magnetic fields in a raster scan across the screen and is modulated in intensity
                at each point forming images at 30 frames/sec (Spindt, 1976)

                PICTURE (1)

           4.  If one microfabricates sharp pyramids about 1.5 micron tall and with radius of 
                curvature of  r~100 Angstroms, and places it very close to a accelerating gate
                electrode, the electric field becomes extremely high at the tip since (E = V/r).
                The surface charge density is highest where the radius of curvature is minimum
                (Serway, pp 692-693).
                Cone material can be molybdenum, silicon, diamond (all have diff W's).
                With only 100 to 300V,  electric fields ~10^7 V/cm result that can generate
                an electron beam.  Low V compared to 1,000 to 30,000V, and not heated at the
                cathode!!!  Vacuum with ion-pump to 10-9 Torr; Good since can easily drive
                these displays with solid-state circuitry (matrix addressing system); 99% of the
                current into this device goes to the phosphors, so very efficient and bright!!!

                (Spindt 1976, 1989)

                PICTURE(1-2)  (Temple p 151)
             
          5.  Quantitative look at field emission:  Fowler-Nordheim Equation (Temple):
   
                     I/V^2 = (A a B^2 / W) exp (-b W^3/2 /BV)        (Temple- use picture)

                     I = emission current  = dq/dt
                    V = operating voltage
                    W = work function for emitter material
                    a   =  emission area 
                    B =  field enhancement factor
                    A,b = constants

                   where E = BV  (E = electric field at the tip, V tip to gate voltage)

                   NOTE:  B is most important parameter (maximize to maximize I)
                                
                                B is affected strongest by tip radius r and gate aperature d

                      (show graphs, Temple, p 151)  want to minimize r and d!!!

                      e.g. if decrease tip r by 2 nm, tenfold increase in I!!! (Temple, p 151)

           6.  Maximum currents 50-150 uA per pyramid.  In average, can operate at 10 
                A/cm2 continuously, much higher than thermionic cathode with a good life 
                expectancy 


 C. Typical Device Architecture:
    
       (Picture)  Spindt (1989) p 226 

      1.  Emitting surface on baseplate (e.g. Si wafer)  250 um on each side of pixels
           each with red, green, blue color element (Spindt 1989, p 225)
      2.  Addressing:  in one direction by parallel metal films (molybdenum) 175 um wide
           with 250 um centers and in the perpendicular direction by parallel gate films 
           (one for each color element per pixel) 40 um wide, 66 um centers  ->
           pixel addressing is row-column so can eliminate active-matrix technology (simple)
      3.  100 tips per color element (redundancy good in case a few break)
      4.   A typical display can be a square array of 338 X 338 pixels
      5.   Screen coated with transparent conducting indium tin oxide (ITO) film with the
            stipes of RED, BLUE, GREEN pixels (perpend to gate lines)
      6.   Faceplate spaced from baseplate by 50 X 50 X 75 um pilars resting on 75 um
            wide stripes between the cathode lines
      7.   Cathodes close to screen so little crosstalk between pixels (p 226)  (Spindt)
      8.   Jan 1995, Temple et al got 18 mA for array of 6648 tips, and a working array of
            232,630 tips (3E+6 tips/cm^2) on a 4-inch Si 100 n-type wafer -> highest current 
            values/largest working FEAs at that time!

    D.  Micron's Version: FED
           1.  microscopic pointed cathodes aimed at each phosphor pixel
           2.  high energy electrons strike pixels causing them to glow
           3.  thousands of arrays of cathodes focused at each pixel 
           4.  separate blue, red, blue beams combine to make color images 

   E. Major Alternative Design -.SI Diamond Technology Corp Version: Diamond FED
           1.  Display created by unique electron-emission qualities of diamond by facing
                the diamond-coated plate with a phosphor coated plate and applying a
                200-300V voltage (diamond has lowest W!!!) 
                Using Fowler-Nordheim, measured W as 0.2 to 0.3 eV (Source #3, Kumar, 
                p 71)
           2.  Diamond's wide bandgap and negative electron affinity even allow
                it to emit electrons at room temperature, and in air/water (Jou, 44).
           3.  Metal and Si microtips expensive since require lithographic fabrication and 
                need to operate at low pressures ~ 1E-7 torr  vs. 1E-4 torr for diamond (Jou)
           5.  Since diamond intrinsically repels electrons, diamond emitters need not be 
                sharp (Jou)
           6.  Easier to fabricate and operate at fields 1,000 times lower then met/Si emitters
           7.  No color filters, backlight -> simple, cheap design


III.  How FED's are made (microfabrication processes):

       (2 Pictures - Spindt, 1976 p 5248, 5249)

       A.  At SRI, Charles A. Spindt et al were among the first to develop microfabrication 
             techniques to make the FEA's in the early 1970's (Spindt 1976)
             1.  Began with 5 cm diameter, 0.75 mm thick heavily doped (0.01 Ohm/cm) 
                  silicon wafer substrate (since easy to grow a thick, well adhering 1 micron 
                  oxide on the surface) (p 5249)
             2.  Grow a 1.5 um oxide on the wafer with standard method
             3.  Using scribe, cut wafers into squares large enough to handle
             4.  Coat Oxide with 0.4 um thick layer of molybdenum using electron beam 
                  evaporation (FAB1)
             5.  Coat the molybdenum side with electron-sensitive photoresist (Poly-
                  methyl-methacrylate, PMM) to 1 um thick with std spinning methods
             6.  Expose photoresist surface to pattern of electron beams to form an array
                  of spots with 1 micron diameter
             7.  Remove the PMM and etch oxide down to Si base with HF solution (FAB2)
             8.  Mount substrate in vacuum deposition system and rotate horizontally
             9.  Deposit aluminum layer at grazing incidence to decrease hole sizes to a
                  desired diameter (FAB3)
            10.  Deposit molybdenum through the holes with electron beam evaporation
                   from a small source perpendicular to the substrate -> Since the size of hole
                   decreases now, a cone grows inside hole (less and less molybdenum can
                   condense inside there) (FAB4)
            11.  Starting aperture size,  oxide thickness, and distance between the substrate
                   and the evaporating source allow one to control the cone height, angle, radius 
                   of curvature at tip
            12.  Finally, dissolve the aluminum layer to release the molybdenum film on top  
                   (FAB5)

     B.  H. F. Gray at the Naval Research Laboratory - another method
           Only one precise mask and one crude mask to define the extraction electrodes, 
           self-alignment of gate electrode to the pyramids, r ~ 100 Angstroms (#2, p 144)
     
            (2 - pictures:  Temple, p151, Gray 1993, p 144) 

              1.  Start with 4-in <100> n-type Si wafers (Source #2, H.F. Gray, 1993)
              2.  Grow 150 nm oxide at 1000 C in wet furnace and then deposit Si3N4
              3.  Pattern it photolithographically (Temple, p152)
              4.  Reactive Ion Etch it to form a mask and remove oxide with buffered
                   oxide etch (1a)
              5.  Anisotropic etch with ethylenediamine-based solution to make square 
                   pyramid bounded by <111> planes and still has a 200 nm flat nitride top;
                   choose solution conc so pyramid base contained within diameter of cap (1b) 
                   (can also use isotropic dry etch with SF6, O2, Ar plasma)
              6.  Sharpen the pyramid by linear oxidation in 850 C dry oxygen furnace
                   (grow oxide half as thick as the pyramid's flat top) 
              7.  Use electron-beam evaporation to directionally evaporate an insulator onto
                   the substrate
              8.  Anneal this insulator at 850 C in oxygen for 16 hours to enhance the oxide-
                   breakdown field (up to ~5 MV/cm) (1c)
              9.  Liftoff process to form extraction electrode (grid):
            10.  Make photoresist pattern with a sloped sidewall 
            11.  Directional metal deposition (1d)
            12.  Remove the metal deposited on top of the photoresist with acetone (1e)
            13.  The metal was self-aligned to the pyramid
            14.  Oxide cap on pyramid's top and the layer on the pyramid's sidewall etched
                   away with buffered HF solution (1f)
            15.  Finally, one can further oxidize the <111> planes to make uniformly sharp
                   field emitters (r ~ 100 Angstroms!!!)
            16.  6 um centers array 


	1.  Column-based silicon field emitter arrays
                  a.  anisotropic or isotropic etching of silicon to make sharp emitter tips
                  b.  232 630 tips on 4-10 mu m centers (Temple et. al)
            2.  Orientation Dependent Etching and a linear thermal-oxidation process
                  uniform, reproducible FEAs made (more than 10 mu A per tip and less
                  than 140 Vdc extraction voltages) -> modulation voltages in 40V region
                  (Gray et al). 
            3.  0.4 mu m grid apertures for FEA cathodes: (Spindt et al)
                 a.  Optical 5:1 lithography with a g-line stepper (NA equals 0.33): 1 mu m res
                 b.  Then Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) with spacer technique: to 0.4 mu m res
                 c.  Field Emission tips made using self-aligning evaporation technique
                 d.  100 tips per 25 mu m area 


     C.  Diamond Film Technique (SI Diamond Technology, Houston, TX and
                  (Microelectronics and Computer Technology, Austin, TX) (Source #3)
(2 pictures)

           1.  Summary:  Laser ablation technique:  
           1.  A laser beam focused on a graphite target vaporizes it
           2.  Highly ionized energetic carbon atoms condense and form diamond film
                on silicon, glass, or metal plate (deposit amorphic diamond films at room 
                temp)
           3.  No micron-scale lithography
           4.  Use shadow mask processes for large-area DFED displays



  	

IV.  Conclusions:
     A.  Vacuum Tubes once dominated, then semiconductor transistors, and integrated
