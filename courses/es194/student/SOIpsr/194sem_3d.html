<H2>Oxygen Implantation through Masking Layers</H2>
<H3>Typically, device isolation in SOI films is achieved through etching of the silicon or local oxidation (LOCOS).  An alternate approach, reported by Bussmann et al, utilizes masking layers to isolate silicon islands during implantation.<P>

Notable advantages:

<LI>Fewer processing steps
<LI>Possible planar wafer surface
