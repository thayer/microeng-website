<H2>Implanted Oxide vs. Nitride</H2>
<H3>In general, oxide implantation has been the technique more commonly used.  The primary reasons are:
<UL>
<LI>Better electrical properties of interface
<LI>Better diffusion
</UL>
The following diagrams show how the difference in diffusion properties affects the formation of buried oxide and nitride layers.  A graph for oxygen is shown on the left, nitrogen on the right.<P>
