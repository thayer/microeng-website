<H2>Lateral Solid Phase Epitaxy</H2>
<H3>Lateral solid phase epitaxy is a method for fabricating silicon on insulator in which a silicon layer is epitaxially grown over a layer of oxide.  The process follows these basic steps:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Start with standard Si wafer.
<LI>Grow oxide layer.
<LI>Etch holes through to substrate
<LI>Deposit Si epitaxially until SiO2 layer is covered to desired depth.
</UL>

For best results, the substrate should be aligned such that the direction of maximum growth is parallel to the surface.<P>

Advantage:  good crystalline quality of epitaxial layer.<P>
Disadvantage:  difficult to control thickness.<P>
