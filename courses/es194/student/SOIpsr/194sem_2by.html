<H2>Early growth phase</H2>
<H3>Important characteristics of the silicon/insulator boundary are determined during the early growth phase. Below are SEM micrographs showing how heteroepitaxial silicon layers are initially formed.<P>

It has been established that films which achieve complete coverage of the substrate the fastest exhibit better electronic properties, i.e. higher mobilities.
