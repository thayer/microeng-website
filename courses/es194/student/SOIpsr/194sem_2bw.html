<H2>Epitaxial Growth Pressure</H2>
<H3>Traditionally, heteroepitaxial silicon has been grown in atmospheric pressure (APCVD) conditions.  However, it is also possible to grow the epitaxial layer in vacuum (LPCVD) conditions.  Some advantages and disadvantages of this method are:

<UL>
<LI>Advantage:  Can deposit Si at lower temperatures than is possible with APCVD systems.  
<LI>In range from 850 to 950 C, autodoping is reduced.
<LI>In range from 650 to 850 C, substrate crystal structure at surface is maintained
<LI>Advantage:  Can characterize surface and perform deposition in the same system
<LI>Advantage:  No carrier gases to potentially react
<LI>Disadvantage:  Contamination more difficult to control
</UL>
