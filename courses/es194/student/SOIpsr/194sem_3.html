<The idea behind implanted insulator technologies is the following:  If we can implant ions of oxygen or nitrogen into the surface of an ordinary silicon wafer at a high energy level, these ions will accumulate according to a gaussian distribution which has a peak some distance below the surface of the silicon.  If the energy of the ions is high enough, they will tend not to damage the crystal structure near the surface of the wafer.  In the region where the concentrations are higher, if the dose approaches the stoichiometric value, we can form a layer of the oxide SiO2 or Si3N4.  If we then anneal the wafer, we can repair much of the damage done by the implantation.  The end result should be a sharply defined layer of insulator embedded in the substrate.>
