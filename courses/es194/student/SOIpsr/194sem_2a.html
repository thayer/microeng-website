<H2>Substrate Materials</H2>
<H3>The three key factors which have been used to qualify the suitability of substrate materials for heteroepitaxial silicon-on-insulator are the following:
<UL>
<LI>Lattice match between substrate and silicon
<LI>Contamination of silicon layer from substrate
<LI>Thermal contraction of substrate relative to silicon
<LI><I>Compatibility with existing silicon processing methods</I>
</UL>
<I>(Cullen, 9)</I>
<P>
The materials which have been found most suitable to this purpose include:
<UL>
<LI>Sapphire (Al2O3)
<LI>Spinel (MgAl2O4)
</UL>
