<H2>Growth temperature/ growth rate</H2>
<H3>The Tradeoff:
<UL>
<LI>Low temperature/ high rate:  Less reaction products incorporated.  Less misorientation in growing film.
<LI>High temperature/ low rate:  Good lattice formation.  More autodoping.
<LI>Overall trend is towards high rate/ low temperature processes.
</UL>

A possible solution is to grow at a fast rate until the surface is completely covered, then at a slower rate to reach the desired thickness.  Rate is more easily changed than temperature. <P>
