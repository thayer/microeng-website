<H2>Substrate/Silicon Reactions</H2>
<H3>Reactions between the substrate and the gases used in deposition can create defects in the crystal structure of the epitaxial silicon near the interface.  These defects can affect electronic properties by:
<UL>
<LI>Distortion of crystal lattice by interstitials or substitution defects
<LI>Disruption of carrier mobilities by charged defects
<LI>Alteration of carrier concentrations ("autodoping")<P>
Example:  3Si + Al2O3  <=> @Al + 3SiO
</UL>
