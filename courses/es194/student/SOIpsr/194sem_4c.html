<H2>Liquid Phase Epitaxy</H2>
<H3>Liquid Phase Epitaxy is a variation on the technique of Lateral Solid Phase Epitaxy in which the silicon source is not in the form of a gas, but rather a supersaturated liquid.  As the liquid is cooled past the saturation point, the silicon condenses on any exposed silicon surface.  Zingg et al fabricated SOI layers using this process with an indium solution and fabricated devices in the layers.  They reported:
<UL>
<LI>Lateral/ vertical growth rate = 40:1
<LI>High mobilities (540 cm2/Vs)
<LI>Electrically active dopants:  4e16/cm3
<LI>Some defective growth initiated by lattice damage
</UL>
