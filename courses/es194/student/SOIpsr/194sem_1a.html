<H2>Parasitic Capacitance Explained</H3>
<H3>

Any chunk of CMOS circuitry can be modeled with resistance-capacitance 
networks.  Each transistor is represented by a capacitance at the gate and a 
resistance across the channel.  Wires (segments of metal or polysilicon) also 
have both a resistance and capacitance with respect to the substrate.  Thus we 
can take the following simple circuit

and model it using RC networks, for the case in which the output switches from 
high to low.<P>

Where V0 = Vdd, R0 and C0 represent the resistance and capacitance of the 
wire, R1 represents the resistance of the driving transistor channel, and C1 
represents the capacitance of the gates being charged.  If we lump these 
components together as R and C, we can calculate that the voltage across C1, 
which represents the input voltage of the second inverter, will go as<P>


Vin2 = V0*exp(-t/RC)

The delay in the system is proportional to RC.  For this reason, designers 
would like to minimize resistances and capacitances in CMOS circuits.<P>  But 
how does one determine the resistance and capacitance of a wire? 
 <P>Resistance is given by<P>

<I>R = (rho)L/tw<P></I>

Where L, t, and w are the length, thickness and width of the wire.  Since 
thickness is typically fixed by the fabrication technology, resistance is 
proportional to L/w, so we can refer to the resistance of wires in a given 
technology as x <I>ohms/square.</I>  In terms of fabrication, the only factors 
which affect resistance are the resistivity of the wire material and its 
thickness.  <P>

To get an estimate of parasitic capacitance, we will use an oversimplified 
model.  Consider a wire to be a parallel plate capacitor, with the substrate 
acting as the bottom plane.  The equation for capacitance of a parallel plate 
arrangement is<P>

<I>C = (epsilon0)A/d<P></I>

In this expression, d refers to the distance from the conducting substrate. 
 This is the key factor which motivated the interest in silicon-on-insulator. 
 Because, if we can increase the distance of the wires from the conducting 
plane of the substrate, or eliminate the conducting substrate altogether, 
capacitance can be significantly reduced.  Since resistance is not affected, 
this indicates that we should be able to build faster circuits using SOI.<P>
