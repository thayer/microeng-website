The term silicon-on-insulator refers to a group of technologies in which a thin layer of single crystal silicon is formed over a layer of insulator.  The primary objective is to fabricate electronic devices in the silicon layer.  The advantages of circuits formed in this manner over those formed in a uniform silicon substrate are principally the following:<P>
