<H2>Insulator Ion Implantation Process</H2>
<H3>The formation of SiO2 by ion implantation occurs in the manner shown in the following figure<P>

<H3>
<DL>
<DT>The phases shown correspond to
<DD>(a) Ions initially accumulate according to Gaussian distribution.  Damage from implant amorphizes silicon in the region of highest impact.
<DD>(b) Concentration reaches stoichiometric proportions to form SiO2.
<DD>(c) Oxide layer grows outward, consuming silicon.
<DD>(d) After annealing, damaged (amorphous) layers become polycrystalline.
</DL>
Notice that, in order to form the abrupt interface between oxide and silicon, we need to implant a large dose of oxygen.  This result can be seen in the chart below.  Also notice that if the dose is too great, the surface crystalline layer can be lost.<P>
