<h2>Sputter</table>

<h2>Sputtering and CVD are now the dominant deposition technologies. It is only in the last 30 years or so that sputtering has emerged as a large-scale production process, particularly in the semiconductor and tool-coating industries....principle
<ul>
<li>Unique Characteristic of Sputtering
<h3><ul><li>Deposition rates do not differ a great deal from one material to another, this is often a useful feature in multilayer depositiones
<li>Deposition rates by sputtering are much lower for some materials and much higher for another materials tham deposition rates by evaporation
<li>Thickness control is very simple, After a calibration run has been made, thickness control is merely a matter of setting a timer.
<li> The lifetime of a sputtering target may be as long as hundreds of runs and is seldom less than 20. This is in sharp contrast to evaporation, where a source seldom lasts as long as 10 runs
<li>In sputtering alloys and other complicated materials, the deposit maintains stoichiometry with the original target composition. No other method can be used to deposit alloys.
<li>Cleaning of parts and substrates by reverse sputtering is an advantage that can be gauned with no other process. One can combine sputterung-ck=leanig with vacuum evaporation. This problem. known as spitting, doesnot occur in sputtering.
<li>The high ejection energy of sputtered atoms is often suggested as a factor in improving film structure and adhersion to the substrate. This is not very likely to be a detectable factor/ It is our experience that, where sputtering-cleaning is not used. the adhesion of a given material to a given substrate is the same for sputtered deposit as for evaporated deposits.</ul></p>




sputtering cleaning results a very reactive surface can be rapidly contaminated if exposed to reactive gases.//p15
<li>Another effect is the return of sputtered particales to the target surface. The majority of sputtered particales are neutral--some of these neutrals are ionized in the dischage and return to the target, while some of the netrals are scattered back to the target surface, These effects are not generally considered to be important in the ion plating process, though they may be important if the deposition rate is low and the sputtering rate is high as the interfacial region is being formed.This might be the case where the substrate potential is slowly decreased to the point where a film is allowed to form.//p16

<h2>Reactive sputtering//Thin Oxide films</p>
<h3><ul><li>species are sputtered in a reactive atmosphere such as N2 or CH4
<li>Used extensively for the depostion of nitride and carbides
<li>Comments: <ul><li>wide variety of coatings<li>good adhesion and composition control<li>temperature is not as high as CVD.<li>Major disadvantages are 1. Low deposition rate; 2. line-of-sight characteristic.

<h2>Bias Sputtering//ditto</p>

<h3>(green//p79)sputtering as discussed in this section, is defined as the removal of surface materialby means of ion bombardment. the use of the word "ion" is really unnecessary because there is nosignificant difference in the effects produced by neutral stom bombardment. However. it is experimentally more convinient to use ions, since they can be accelerated to any desired velocity. 

<h2>Important parameters <h2>of the bombarding projectile to consider in sputtering are its kinetic energy to individual atoms of target. This type of transfer distiguishes the sputtering process from techniques which involve chemical reaction and subsequent release of volatile compounds.</p>
