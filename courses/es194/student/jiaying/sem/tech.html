<h1>INDUSTRAL POTENTIAL OF ION PLATING AND SPUTTERING(blue)//p115</p>



<h1>AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ION PLATING EQUIPMENT(blue)//p135





<h2><li>Sputtering clean has been shown to be the most universal technique for obtaining atomically clean metal surfacees in a vacuum envirionment(ref 6)//p14
<li>for insulators and plastics, exposure to a plasma may result in surface changes that given better adhesion//blue p15 useful later

<h3>Text#1 P374 Sputtering will continue to be the most imortant PVD process in Silicon VLSI fabrication for some time. <br>
But there are some challenges:<ol>
<li>wafers will grow larger, and uniform films on such wafers will need to be deposited with high throughput
<li>The machines will need to operate at higher levels of cleaness 
<li>greater reliability (e.g. >90% up time)will be expected
<li>The machines will become progressively more automated and controllable from a central fatory computer
<li>The ability to improve step coverage or even planized deposited films , this feature will be avidly sought in new sputtering equipment designs
<li>Alternative techniques to replace (or enhance) sputter etching for <i>in situ</i> cleaning of small area openings will be developed
<li> as multilevel interconnect technologies are developed, more multilayer films ( e.g Ti;W/Al-Cu; or Ti/Al-Si/Ti/Al-Si/Ti) will be utilized.
</oL>
sputter equipment will be called upon to deposit such complex films with high throughput
