<h3>Why use PVD, compare to CVD


<h4>Like CVD, PVD is a vapor deposition process where the depostition species are atoms or molecules or a combination of these. The distinction between these process is that , in CVD, deposition occured by chemical reaction, whereas in PVD, deposition is by condensation. CVD is usually endothermic at the substrate and PVD is exothermic.
<ul><li> the source of the PVD species may be evaporation or sputtering, An important recent trend is the tendency for the two processes, CVD and PVD, to merge. CVD, for instance. now makes extensive use of plasma(a physical phenomenon( and conversely, reactive evaporation and reactive sputtering occur in a chemical environment. CVD and PVD reactors are now combined in one single piece of equipment in new semiconductor processing operation and the difference between the two processes becomes blurred. PVD processes are decribed as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Evaporation is the simplest PVD process. It is also known as vacuum evaporation...principle
<li>Sputtering and CVD are now the dominant deposition technologies. It is only in the last 25 years or so that sputtering has emerged as a large-scale production process, particularly in the semiconductor and tool-coating industries....principle
<li>Ion Plating is an hybrid process in which the coating material is vaporized in a manner similar to evaporation but passes through a gaseous glow discharge or plasma, as it travels toward the substrate, thus ionizing many of the atoms. The plasma is obtained by biasing the substrate to a high negative potential(5kv) at low pressure. The constant ion bombardment of the substrate sputters off some of the surface atoms which results in improved adhesion and reduced impurities. Step coverage is also improved. APPLICATION: used in the production of optical thin films, in wear- and erosion-resistant applications and in some electrical contact designs.</ul>
