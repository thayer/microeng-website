<h2><dt>Sputtering:
<h3><dd>Sputtering is a process whereby coating material is dislodged and ejected from the solid surface due to the momentum exchange associated with surface bombardment by energetic particles.
</dt>


<hr>
<h2>Processes:<h3><ul>
<li>Gas ions are accelerated by a high voltage, producing a glow discharge or plasma
<li>A source (the cathode, also called the <i>target</i> ) is bombarded in high vacuum by gas ions
<li>Atoms from the target are ejected by momentum transfer and move across the vacuum chamber
<li>Atoms are deposited on the substrate to be coated and form a thin film.
</ul>

<h2>Sputtering Mechanism</p>
<img src="sputter.gif">
<h3>The exact mechanisms by which atoms are ejected from a surface under ion bombardment are unknown, but we can deduce some of the details of the interaction involved.<br>
The kinetic energy of the impinging particles largely dictates which event will happen
<ol>
<li>Bounce back : <ul><li>when very low energy (<5eV); <li>when the collision is head-on or nearly so</ul>
<li>Embedded : when much higher energy (>10KeV), the impinging particles are most likely to be embedded in the target, which is the basis of <i>Ion Implantation</I>
<li>Energy between the two extremes, two other effects also arise:<ul>
<li>some fraction of the energy of the impinging ions is transferred to the solid in the form of heat, and lattice damage
<li>another fraction of such energy causes atoms from the surface to be dislodged and ejected into the gas phase----<i>Sputtering</i></ul>
</ol>

<hr>
<h2>Unique characters <h3><ul>
<li>Uniform thickness over large-area.

<li>Simple thickness control

<li>The alloy composition maintains stoichiometry with the original target composition.

<li>Deposition rates do not differ a great deal from one material to another.

<li>Sputtering-cleaning prior to initiating film deposition. The surface is not again exposed to ambient after such cleaning.

<li>The lifetime of a sputtering target may be as long as hundreds of runs and is seldom less than 20.
