<h2>Vapor Deposition Advantages and Disadvantages
<h2>* Advantages:<ul>
<h3><li>Versatile in the composition of coating materials
<li>Thin films (as low as a couple of nanometres thick)
<li>High purity, high adhesion 
<li>Unusual microstructure or self-supported shapes at high deposition rates.
<li>Reproduce surface topography and generally do not require posttreatment/postfinishing.
</Ul>
<h2>* Disadvantage:<ul> <h3><li>High capital cost and processing costs associated with vacuum systems.</ul>



 the source of the PVD species may be evaporation or sputtering, An important recent trend is the tendency for the two processes, CVD and PVD, to merge. CVD, for instance. now makes extensive use of plasma(a physical phenomenon( and conversely, reactive evaporation and reactive sputtering occur in a chemical environment. CVD and PVD reactors are now combined in one single piece of equipment in new semiconductor processing operation and the difference between the two processes becomes blurred. 

<h2>HCD EB guns<ul>
<li>Cathode is made of a refactory metal since it oprate at elevated temperature
	<li>An ionized gas, usually argon, is introduced to the system through the tube-shaped cathode.
	<li>A pressure drop across the office in the cathode porvides a sufficient amount og gas inside the cathode to sustain the plasma, which generate the beam.
</ul>

<h2>Notes
<h3>
<dd>Energetic particles are usually positive ions and energetic neutrals of a heavy inert or reactive gas or species of coating material(argon is the most commonly used inert gas).
<dd> The sputtered material is ejected primarily in atomic form from the source of the coating material, called the <i>target</i>.
<dd>The sputtering momentum exchange occurs primarily within a region extending only about 1nm below the surface.
<dd> The process used for producing ions are glow-discharge ionization and ion beam sources.

<i>work-accelerated gun</i>, more usually called in moden practice <i>self-accelerated gun</i> means: the electric field is maintained between the cathode and the evaporant(the 'work')
