<h2><dt>Reactive evaporation :
<h3><dd>Metal atoms are evaporated from an evaporant source with a partial pressure of a reactive gas present in the chamber.
<dd>The reaction between the metal atoms and the gas atoms takes place on the substrate in the vapor phase or on the evaporant source surface to form a compound, for example:
<pre>		4Al(vapor) + 3O2 <==> Al2O3 (solid deposit)
				delta F=-429 kcal/mol at 298K

		2Ti(vapor) + C2H2(gas)<==> 2TiC(solid deposit) + H2(gas)
				delta F= -76 kcal/mol at 298K

</pre><h3><dd>The rate and completeness of the reactions are dependent on the temperature of the substrate and the amount of reactive gas introduced.

<h2>Reactive evaporation is preferred to Direct evaporation for compounds with high melting temperature<h3><ol>
<li>High-power-density source has to be used to obtain appreciable evaporation rates, which result in a physical disintegration of many compound evaporant billets(prepared by pressing and sintering of powders)
<li>Because of partial dissociation of the compounds during the evaporation. 
<br>For example,<ul> 
<li>AL2O3 results in an oxygen deficient coating
<li>TiC coating prepared by direct evaporation are carbon-deficient
</ul>
we can <ul><li>restore AL2O3 by: evaporation in the presence of oxygen or possibly a postdeposition anneal in oxygen,<Li>restore TiC by: evaporation in the presence of a partial pressure of acetylene.</ul>
<li>Stoichiometric oxides, alloys have been formed by reactive oxidation evaporation.</ol>
