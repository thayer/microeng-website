<h2>* Evaporation of alloys and compounds</p>

<h4><img src="metals.GIF">Vapor pressure of metals 

<h2><ul><li>Alloys will fractionate when heated to evaporate temperature
<h3>The component of higher vapor pressure evaporate at a faster rate than the lower vapor pressure components, resulting in a deposition of different composition than original alloy.

<h2>Alloy films are therefore evaporated using 

<h3><li>Simultaneous co-evaporation : <i>two electron guns and two sources</i>, with each source containing only one of the alloy constituents.


<li>Advantages: <br>- better promise of control<br>- possible to co-deposit materials that form neither compounds nor solutions.

<li>Disadvantage:<br>- complex system,<br>- uniformity of deposition across large substrates from two sources is reduced,<br>- relative power applied to the two source must be well controlled to insure that the desired evaporation rates are maintained.<br>- Significantly more difficult to deposit alloys with highly controlled compositions than by sputtering methods.
