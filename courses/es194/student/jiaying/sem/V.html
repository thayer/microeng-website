<h2>Future Trends</table>

<h2>* PVD and CVD <ul>
<h3>- Difference between the two processes becomes blurred.<br>- CVD now makes extensive use of plasma
<br>- Reactive evaporation and reactive sputtering occur in a chemical environment.
<br>- CVD and PVD reactors are now combined in one single piece of equipment in new semiconductor processing operation
</ul>


<hr>
<h2>* Evaporation <h3><ul>Facing strong competition from sputtering and CVD<br>Generally on the decline.</Ul> 

<hr>
<h2>* Sputtering <h3><ul>will continue to be the most important PVD process in Silicon VLSI fabrication for some time.<br>

But there are some challenges:<ol>
<li>Uniform films over larger wafers, higher throughput
<li>The ability to improve step coverage or even planized deposited films , this feature is avidly sought in new sputtering equipment designs
<li>The machines will need to operate at higher levels of cleaness and  more automatically  
<li>Greater reliability (e.g. >90% up time)will be expected  
<li>Techniques to replace (or enhance) sputter etching for <i>in situ</i> cleaning of small area  will be developed
<li>As multilevel interconnected technologies are developed, more multilayer films will be utilized.
