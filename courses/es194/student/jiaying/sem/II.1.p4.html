<h2>Electron-Beam Heating</div></body></table></center>

<h2>E-Beam heating<h3><ul>
<li>The high voltage power supply provides 5 to 10KeV to accelerate the electrons from the filament to the evaporant
<li>Most of kinetic energy of electrons is converted to heat on impingement
</ul>



<hr>
<dt><h2>Thermionic Guns<h3><dd>also hot-cathode or hot-filament guns.<br>Most commonly used for evaporation.<br>Electrons are generated by hot filament of a high temperature alloy such as tungsten.</p>

<hr>
<h2>Plasma Guns<h3><ul>
<li>Electrons are generated within a plasma. By proper application of electric potential, electrons can be extracted from the plasma to provide a useful energy beam similar to that obtained by hot-cathode guns.
<li>Cold-cathode guns
<li>Hot hollow cathode dischage(HCD) guns
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Advantages<h3><ul>
<li>High power density, and hence extremely high temperature (4000C), power utilized with more efficiency

<li>Wide range of control over evaporation rates, high deposition rates up to 75 E-6m/min

<li>E-beam concentrates on the evaporated surface,  support structure for the evaporant is water-cooled, hence, interaction between evaporant and support materials are greatly reduced.

<li>There are no support structure problems so the boat, hearth, or other support structure can be fabricated of almost any material.

</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages<h3><ul>
<li>Interactions between ionized vapor with the hot filament lead to impurities in the deposited film.
</ul>
