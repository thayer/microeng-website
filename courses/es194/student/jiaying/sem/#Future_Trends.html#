<h2>* PVD and CVD
<h3><ul><li>Similarity:<br>
Like CVD, PVD is a vapor deposition process where the deposition species are atoms or molecules or a combination of these.</p>
<li>Distinction:
<pre><h3>PVD   ---deposition done by condensation(exothermic) 
CVD   ---deposition done by chemical reaction(endothermic at the substrate)</pre>
<li><h3>An important recent trend is the tendency for the two processes, CVD and PVD, to merge.  CVD, for instance, now makes extensive use of plasma (a physical phenomenon) and conversely, reactive evaporation and reactive sputtering occur in a chemical environment. CVD and PVD reactors are now combined in one single piece of equipment in new semiconductor processing operation and the difference between the two processes becomes blurred. 
</ul>

<h2>* Evaporation <h3><dt><dd>is facing strong competition from other thin film processes such as sputtering or CVD and is generally on the decline. <h3>Two techniques based on evaporation may reverse this trend.</dt> <ul>
<li>One is based on pulsed excimer laser which acts as a flash vaporize and can evaporate compounds with elements having widely different vapor pressure and complex composition so that the original composition is retained in the deposited film.
<li>The other is molecular beam epitaxy(MBE), it produce extremely pure and very thin films with abrupt composition changes. Deposition rate however is very low. It is used for very exacting and very expensive microwave and opto-electronic devices.</ul>

<h2>* Text#1 P374 Sputtering will continue to be the most important PVD process in Silicon VLSI fabrication for some time.
<h3>But there are some challenges:<ol>
<li>wafers will grow larger, and uniform films on such wafers will need to be deposited with high throughput
<li>The machines will need to operate at higher levels of cleaness 
<li>greater reliability (e.g. >90% up time)will be expected
<li>The machines will become progressively more automated and controllable from a central factory computer
<li>The ability to improve step coverage or even planized deposited films , this feature will be avidly sought in new sputtering equipment designs
<li>Alternative techniques to replace (or enhance) sputter etching for <i>in situ</i> cleaning of small area openings will be developed
<li>As multilevel interconnect technologies are developed, more multilayer films ( e.g Ti;W/Al-Cu; or Ti/Al-Si/Ti/Al-Si/Ti) will be utilized. Sputter equipment will be called upon to deposit such complex films with high throughput

<h2>* Sputtering clean<h3><ul>
<li>Sputtering clean has been shown to be the most universal technique for obtaining atomically clean metal surfaces in a vacuum envirionment(ref 6)//p14
<li>For insulators and plastics, exposure to a plasma may result in surface changes that given better adhesion//blue p15 useful later

<li>The high ejection energy of sputtered atoms is often suggested as a factor in improving film structure and adhesion to the substrate. This is not very likely to be a detectable factor. It is discovered that, where sputtering-cleaning is not used, the adhesion of a given material to a given substrate is the same for sputtered deposit as for evaporated deposits.
