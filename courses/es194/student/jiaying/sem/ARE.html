<dt><h2>Activated Reactive Evaporarion(ARE)
<h3><dd>The evaporation of a metal occurs in the presence of a reactive gas(with a partial pressure of about 10^-2 to 1 Pa or 10^-4 to 10^-2 torr) and a plasma to deposit compounds with increased adhesion and increased deposition rates.</p>

<img align=left src="are.GIF">
<h3><ul><li>Metal is heated and melted by a high-accelaration-voltage e-beam
<li>Metal has a thin plasma sheath on top of it
<li>Low-energy secondary electrons from the plasma sheath are pulled into the reactive zone by an interspace electrode placed above the pool
<li>The electrode is biased to allow positive dc or ac potential (typically 20 to 100 V)
<li>low-energy electrons have a high ionization cross section, thus ionizing or activating the metals and gas atoms.
<li>In addition . collisioms betwwem ions and neutral atims result in charge exchange processes yielding energetic neutrals and positive ions.
<li>It is belived that these energetic netral atoms, "activate" the reaction, thus increasing the reaction between the reactants
</ul>
<h4>Schematic of ARE process using electron beam gun evaporation source


<hr>
<H2>Plasma <h3><ul>
<li>Enhance the reaction between the reactants 
<li>Cause ionization of both the coating metal and gas atoms in the vapor phase
<li>It is generated by :<ul><li>when using e-beam as evaporation source : an interspace positively biased eletrode 
<li>when using resistance-heated source : low-energy electrons injected to the vapor phase from a thermionically heated filament </ul>
</ul>


<hr>

<ul>
<li>Type of coating materials: almost any, e.g. AL2O3, SiO2
<li>Kinetic energy : 5 to 20 eV
<li>Deposition pressure: 10^-2 to 1 Pa or 10^-4 to 10^-2 torr
<li>Deposition temperature : 200 to 1600 C
<li>Coating thickness range : 0.1 to 1000 E-6m
<li>Deposition rate : 1 to 75 E-6m/min
<li>Relative adhesion : Fair to good at elevated temperature
<li>Substrate heated for a good adhesion and microstructure
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Advantages:<h3><ul>
<li>Extremely high deposition rates, variety of coating compositions
<li>Precise control of stoichiometry
<li>Better adhesion
<li>Denser microstructure than Direct evaporation
</ul>
<h2>Disadvantages:<h3><ul>
<li>High substrate temperature
<li>Addition of extra electrode, slightly complicated compare to evaporation
<li>Substrate must generally be rotated for uniform coating
</ul>
