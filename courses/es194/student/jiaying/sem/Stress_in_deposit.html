<h3>Physical vapor-deposition processes, carried out by evaporation and condensation of materials in <a href="u.html"><i>vavuo</i></a> or at low pressure, are probably the least complex coating system to analyze for nature and origin of residual stress. Because the thinness of most evaporated coatings, stresses in them are uaually not made evident by spalling of the coating or wraping of the substrate, but are detected and studied by the broardening effect produced on X-ray diffraction lines (which is difficult to distiguish from the line broadening produced by very small grain size) and by the anisotropic which the stresses induce in the magnetic, electrical, opitical, and other properties.
