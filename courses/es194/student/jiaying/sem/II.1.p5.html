The component of higher vapor pressure evaporate at a faster rate than the lower vapor pressure components, resulting in a deposition of different composition than original alloy.



<h2><li>Alloy films are therefore evaporated using

<h3><li>Simultaneous co-evaporation using <i>two electron guns and two sources</i>, with each source containing only one of the alloy constituents.


<li>Advantages: <br>- Better promise of control<br>- Possible to co-deposit materials that form neither compounds nor solutions.

<li>Disadvantage:<br>- complex system,<br>- uniformity of deposition across large substrates from two sources is reduced,<br>- relative power applied to the two source must be well controlled to insure that the desired evaporation rates are maintained.<br>
<li>Example: Ai-Si alloy<br>- BUT it is significantly more difficult to deposit alloys with highly controlled compositions by either evaporation method than by sputtering methods.

<h2>* Sputtering clean<h3><ul>
<li>Sputtering clean has been shown to be the most universal technique for obtaining atomically clean metal surfaces in a vacuum envirionment(ref 6)//p14
<li>For insulators and plastics, exposure to a plasma may result in surface changes that given better adhesion//blue p15 useful later

<li>The high ejection energy of sputtered atoms is often suggested as a factor in improving film structure and adhesion to the substrate. This is not very likely to be a detectable factor. It is discovered that, where sputtering-cleaning is not used, the adhesion of a given material to a given substrate is the same for sputtered deposit as for evaporated deposits.
