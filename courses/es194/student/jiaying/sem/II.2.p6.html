<h2>* Sputtering clean<h3><ul>
<li>Sputtering clean has been shown to be the most universal technique for obtaining atomically clean metal surfaces in a vacuum environment
<li>For insulators and plastics, exposure to a plasma may result in surface changes that given better adhesion
<li>The high ejection energy of sputtered atoms is often suggested as a factor in improving film structure and adhesion to the substrate. But it is discovered that, where sputtering clean is not used, the adhesion of a given material to a given substrate is the same for sputtered deposit as for evaporated deposits.
