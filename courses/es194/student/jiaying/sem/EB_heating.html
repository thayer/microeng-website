<h2>Electron-Beam Heating</div></body></table></center>

<h2>E-Beam heating<h3><ul>
<li>The high voltage power supply provides 5-10KeV to accelerate the electrons from the filament to the evaporant
<li>Most of kinetic energy of electrons is converted to heat on impingement
</ul>

<hr>
<h2>E-Beam gun composition<h3><ul>
<li>Must consist of at least two elements: a cathode and an anode.
<li>Since they are easily scattered by gas molecules, a vacuum chamber is needed
<li>A potential of several kV is needed to accelerate the electrons emmited from the cathode
</ul>


<hr>
<h2>Electron beam guns can be divided into two types depending on the source of the electrons:<h3><ul>
<h2><li><i>Thermionic Guns</i><h3>also hot-cathode or hot-filament guns.<br>They are most commonly used for evaporation.<br>the electrons are generated by hot filament of a high temperature alloy such as tungsten.</p>

<h2><li><i>Plasma Guns</i><h3><ul>
	<li>Electrons are generated within a plasma. By proper application of electric potential, electrons can be extracted from the plasma to provide a useful energy beam similar to that obtained by hot-cathode guns.
	<li><dt>Cold-cathode guns: <dd>a cylinder cavity made from a metal mesh or sheet containing the ionized plasma from which electrons are extracted from through a small aperture in one end.</dt>
	<li><dt>Hot hollow cathode dischage(HCD) guns : <dd>an ionized gas, usually argon, is introduced to the system through the tube-shaped cathode.<dd>A pressure drop across the office in the cathode porvides a sufficient amount of gas inside the cathode to sustain the plasma, which generate the beam.</dt>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>Advantages<h3><ul>
<h2>Electron beam Heating has two major benifits<h3><ol>
<li>High power density, and hence extremely high temperature and a wide range of control over evaporation rates, from very low to very high
<li>The evaporant is generally contained in a water-cooled copper hearth, thus eliminate the problem of crucible contamination. The coatings from electron beam heating with a water-cooled copper hearth are purest.
</ol>

<li>greater amounts of power can be supplied, and this power is utilized with more efficiency so much higher temperature, 4000C can be achieved, the EB guns are most commonly used for evaporation of materials having high melting points and for high deposition rates up to 25 E-6m/min
<li>It can be concentrated on the evaporated surface while other portions of the evaporant are maintained at lower temperature. Hence, interaction between evaporant and support materials are greatly reduced.
<li>Thus the evaporant is heated directly and energy utilization is much more efficient than with resistance-heated sources.
<li>Power input with an E-beam source can be much greater than with a resistance-heated source if the e-beam system is properly designed.
<li>Since the support structure for the evaporant is water-cooled, the evaporant does not wet or alloy with the source and remains pure. This eliminates the problem of the filament, boat, or other support structure introducing impurities into the coating
<li>E-beam system also resolves the problem of the evaporant high temperature materials. There are no support structure problems so the boat, hearth, or other support structure can be fabricated of almost any material.

</ul>

<h2>Disadvantages<h3><ul>
<li>Problems related to arcing and electrical discharges that result from the high voltage in the presence of high vapor may become ionized, resulting in interaction with the hot filament that lead to impurities in the deposited film.
</ul>
