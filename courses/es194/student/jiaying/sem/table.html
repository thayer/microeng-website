<hr><h2>Why use PVD, compare to CVD?</br>
<h3><pre>			Advantages 				Disadvantages
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Direct/reactive 	Simple, cheap, extremely high  		Low kinetic energy
evaporation		deposition rates, Low pressure		Inadequate adhesion
		        No gas scattering			Impresice control of stoichiometry 
			Incorporation of gas atoms			of compurnd coatings
								Substrate must be rotated for 
									uniform coating

Activate reactive 	Extremely high deposition rates		High substrate temperature
evaporation(ARE)	Variety of coating compositions		Addition of extra electrode 
			Presice control of stoichiometry	Substrate must be rotated for 
			Better adhesion					uniform coating
			Denser microstructure than evaporation

CVD			Wide choice of coating materials 	High substrate temperature
								Low kinetic energy
								Low utilization of starting 
									materials
