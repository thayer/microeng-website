<h1>Ion Plating</p>
<h2>Ion plating is a process in which a substrate is subjected to ion bombardment both before and during the time it is being coated.
<Ul><li>chamber pressure usually on the order of 40m Torr 
<li>a typical ion plating is depicted in FIG 12 //p131
<li>why ion plating and sputtering? is rather easily answered for those interested in lubrication. use vaccuum methods is for depositing solid lubricants.

<h2> <ul>
<li>Ion plating is a generic term applied to atomic deposition processes in which the substrate is subjected to a flux of high energy ions sufficient to cause appreciable sputtering before and during film deposition.//p14
<li>ion bombardment is usually done in an inert gas dischage system similar to that used in sputter depostion, except that in ion plating the substrate is made a sputtering cathode, the substrate is subjected to ion bombardment for a time sufficient to remove surface contaminates and barrier layers surface (sputter cleaning)before deposition of the film material
<li>for a film to form it is necessary that the deposition rate exceed the sputtering rate.
<li>from the stand piont of adhesion the principal benefits obtained from the ion plating process are ability to:<ul>
<li>sputter clean the surface and keep it clean until the film begins to form
<li>provide thus enhancing diffusion and chemical reactions without necessiating heating
<li>alter the surface and interfacial structure by introducing high defect concentrations, physically mixing the film and substrate material, and influencing the nucleation and growth of the depositing film //p14</ul>
<li>Sputtering clean has been shown to be the most universal technique for obtaining atomically clean metal surfacees in a vacuum envirionment(ref 6)//p14

<ul><li>sputtering cleaning results a very reactive surface can be rapidly contaminated if exposed to reactive gases.//p15
<li>Another effect is the return of sputtered particales to the target surface. The majority of sputtered particales are neutral--some of these neutrals are ionized in the dischage and return to the target, while some of the netrals are scattered back to the target surface, These effects are not generally considered to be important in the ion plating process, though they may be important if the deposition rate is low and the sputtering rate is high as the interfacial region is being formed.This might be the case where the substrate potential is slowly decreased to the point where a film is allowed to form.//p16
<li>An effect that has not been studied very extensively is the effect of ion bombardment on the morphology of the growing film.
