<h1>INDUSTRAL POTENTIAL OF ION PLATING AND SPUTTERING(blue)//p115</p>



<h1>AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL ION PLATING EQUIPMENT(blue)//p135





<h2><li>Sputtering clean has been shown to be the most universal technique for obtaining atomically clean metal surfacees in a vacuum envirionment(ref 6)//p14
<li>for insulators and plastics, exposure to a plasma may result in surface changes that given better adhesion//blue p15 useful later

<h3>Text#1 P374 Sputtering will continue to be the most imortant PVD process in Silicon VLSI fabrication for some time. <br>
But there are some challenges:<ol>
<li>wafers will grow larger, and uniform films on such wafers will need to be deposited with high throughput
<li>The machines will need to operate at higher levels of cleaness 
<li>greater reliability (e.g. >90% up time)will be expected
<li>The machines will become progressively more automated and controllable from a central fatory computer
<li>The ability to improve step coverage or even planized deposited films , this feature will be avidly sought in new sputtering equipment designs
<li>Alternative techniques to replace (or enhance) sputter etching for <i>in situ</i> cleaning of small area openings will be developed
<li> as multilevel interconnect technologies are developed, more multilayer films ( e.g Ti;W/Al-Cu; or Ti/Al-Si/Ti/Al-Si/Ti) will be utilized.
</oL>
sputter equipment will be called upon to deposit such complex films with high throughput


 the source of the PVD species may be evaporation or sputtering, An important recent trend is the tendency for the two processes, CVD and PVD, to merge. CVD, for instance. now makes extensive use of plasma(a physical phenomenon( and conversely, reactive evaporation and reactive sputtering occur in a chemical environment. CVD and PVD reactors are now combined in one single piece of equipment in new semiconductor processing operation and the difference between the two processes becomes blurred. 


Evaporation is facing strong competition from other thin film processes such as sputtering or CVD and is generally on the decline. <h3>Two techniques based on evaporation may reverse this trend. <ul>
<li>One is based on pulsed excimer laser which acts as a flash vaporize and can evaporate compounds with elements having widely different vapor pressure and complex composition so that the original composition is retained in the deposited film.
<li>The other is molecular beam epitaxy(MBE), it produce extremely pure and very thin films with abrupt composition changes. Deposition rate however is very low. It is used for very exacting and very expensive microwave and opto-electronic devices.</ul>
