<h1>DEPOSITION OF METAL AND ALLOY COATINGS BY ELECTRON-BEAM ION PLATING(blue)//p89
<h2><ul>
<li>Until recently, the ion-plating process has been generally limited to the deposition of low-melting materials for coating application, high temperature materials were deposited generally at low deposition rates.
<li>However, several electron-beam techniques have been investigated at Battelle's Columbus Laboratoryies which provide methods for evaporating high-melting-point materials within a glow-discharge atmosphere for high-deposition-rate applications. The magnetically focused hot-filament and the cold hollow-cathode electron sources have been studied to evaluate their operational and evaporation-depoaition characteristics for the ion plating process(refs 1 to 3). These electron-beam techniques and the results of past and current experiments conducted using these technoques are described in this paper.
