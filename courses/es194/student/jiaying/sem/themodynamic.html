<h2>PVD:
<h3>All PVD processes proceed according to the following sequence of steps:
<ol><li>The material to be deposited (solid /liquid source) is physically converted to a vapor phase
<li>The vapor is transported across a region of reduced pressure (from the source to the substrate)
<li>the vapor condenses on the substrate to form a thin film.
</ol>


<h2>Physical transport Processes(green//p28-31)
<h3><ul>
<li>Physical transport processes--- are the simplest of all vapor-deposition processes. In
<li>Chemical transport processes(fundamental considerations)
<ul><li>a large number of reactions are useful for chemical transport purposes, as... some are the bases for the practical applications discusses in details in chapter 12
<li>If the various thermodynamic factors are known or can be esmated with reasonable accuracy, a complete analysis and transport information, should lead to the determination of the optimum operating conditions
<li>a short review before considering the use of the thermodynamics for this purpose.<ul>three laws or axioms, all discovered after 1950s.
<li>first come, the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy may be transformed from one to another of its many forms, mechanical, thermal, chemical. electrical. radiant. etc,, but van never be created or destroyed.
<li>Hess's law: the total energy in a series of reactions depends only on the nature of the initial reactants and the final products and is independenr of the number and nature of any intermediate reactions....

<h3>Physical vapor-deposition processes, carried out by evaporation and condensation of materials in <a href="u.html"><i>vavuo</i></a> or at low pressure, are probably the least complex coating system to analyze for nature and origin of residual stress. Because the thinness of most evaporated coatings, stresses in them are usually not made evident by spalling of the coating or wraping of the substrate, but are detected and studied by the broardening effect produced on X-ray diffraction lines (which is difficult to distiguish from the line broadening produced by very small grain size) and by the anisotropic which the stresses induce in the magnetic, electrical, opitical, and other properties.
