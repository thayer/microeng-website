<DT>   B.  The wafers sent out were:  <100> p-type Si, with holes etched 1 micron field oxide, 1 micron deposited poly features.  There was no photoresist, and hence no beam current limit. <P>
<DT>   C.  The desired implant was as follows:
<P>
<DD>  Energy:  100keV 
<DD>  Species:  Phosphorus
<DD>  Dose:  1 x 10^15 cm-2 .
<P>
