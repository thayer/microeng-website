<DT><U><B>A.  Aluminum Metal Deposition</B>
<DD> 1.  Used Varian Electron Beam Evaporator, in Wilder Room 5, with an Electron Beam Power Supply ES-6
<DD>  2.     Goal to deposit uniform 0.5 to 1 micron film of Aluminum on 
two wafers
<DD>  3.      Chamber was pre-pumped to a vacuum hours before starting
<DD>  4.      Chamber filled with air, 2 wafers loaded in it
<DD>  5.  Reduced pressure down to 6E-6 Torr (with mechanical pump and then diffusion pump)
<DD>  6.     Wafers' temperature set at 205 C 
<DD>  7.     Used 50% power to generate electron beam which evaporated an aluminum source (2.7 g/cm^3)
<DD>  8.      Deposited Al onto wafers at a rate of  5 Angstroms/sec (current = 280 mA)
<DD>  9.      According to the quartz crystal sensor, a total of 1.15 microns of
Aluminum was deposited onto the wafers (although probably LESS was actually deposited since this sensor should be a little off)
