<H3> 2. Objective:</H3>
<H4>The objective of this lab is to create integrated circuits which include Enhancement Mode N-channel MOSFETS, capacitors, and ring oscillators.  We shall build these devices using the facilities at the <A HREF = "https://microeng.engineering.dartmouth.edu">Solid State Lab</A> in Thayer School.  We will be gaining experience with the process steps which are crucial to the microelectronics industry, namely oxidation, photolithography, wet etching, deposition, ion implantation, and annealing.  <P> </H4>

<H3>5. Conclusions:</H3>
<DT>  A.  The wafers looked good under the optical microscope
<DT>  B.  Electrical Test Results imply bad contact or failure of dopants to diffuse under the gate in MOSFETS
<DT>  C.  Clearly, IV curves imply that there is NO diode behavior here since the IV should be exponential, not linear
<DT>  D.  After looking under the electron microscope, we concluded that not enough Aluminum was deposited to make a good electrical contact with the poly-silicon gate for one wafer and the other wafer was misaligned
<DT>  E.  Hence, the wafer MOSFETs did not operate since there were bad connections between the metal contacts and the poly-silicon gates
<DT>  F.   We may have overetched the aluminum, the photoresist #4 could have receded too much, or simply not deposited enough Aluminum
<DT>  G.  If we strip the aluminum, redeposit it, and redefine it photolithographically, the MOSFETs should work properly.
