<P> <B> Week #3: Gate Oxide & Polysilicon Definition (Oct 17, 1995) </B>  
<DL> 
<DT>  <U> A.  Examine Etched Wafers Under Optical Microscope</U> 
<DD>  1)   Near small alignment holes, some discolorization (wafers 2,6)
<DD>  2)   Rounded off alignment marks (wafer #4)
<DD>  3)   Wednesday Group's Wafers were clearer in general
<P>
<DT>   B.   Remove Photoresist Mask #1
<DD>   1)   Immerse wafers in 800 ml of ACT at room temp, 3 minutes
<DD>   2)   Gently rinse with DI
<DD>   3)   Dry wafers with nitrogen gas
<P>
<DT>   C.   Grow 0.05 micron SiO2 Gate Oxide  
<DD>   1)   DRY Oxidation Furnace <A HREF =

<DD>             a) Flushed Furnace 0.628 ft^3 inner furnace w/ O2 gas at             8 scfh for 10 minutes
<DD>               b) Heat 1 hour at 970 C, 2 scfh gas flow (1/3 hr warmup, 1 hour cool down)<P>
<DD>   2)   <A HREF =
