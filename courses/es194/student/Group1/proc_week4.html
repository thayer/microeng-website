<TITLE>  Week 4:  Annealing and Polysilicon Gate Definition </TITLE>
<P> <B> Week #4: Annealing and Polysilicon Gate Definition (Oct 24, 1995) </B>  
<DL> 
<DT>  <U> A.  RCA rinse of 3 good wafers with Si deposit (E, B, 3) </U> 
<DD>  1)  Lost wafer D due to pealing of deposited Si
<DD>  2)  3 wafers without numbers have just gate field oxide
<DD>  3)  wafers 1,2,4,5,6, A and C have just gate field oxides too
<P>
<DT> <U>  B.   Measured the Thickness of Deposited Silicon
<DD>  1)     Used Alpha Step 100 (Tencor Instruments)
<DD>  2)     Measured Thickness at edge of deposit at several locations (avg thickness = 1 um) <P>
<DD>             Location #1: (Note Deflection is curl at edge of Si deposit) <P>

<DD>             Location #2: (Note Deflection is curl at edge of Si deposit) <P>

<P>
<DD>   3)  Also measured Width of Scribeline (280 um) <P>

<P>
<DD>   4)  Finally, measured Depth of Trench at Any Angle <P>

<DT>  <U> C.   Two Hour Anneal (convert amorphous Si to poly)
<DD>  1)   For 5 minutes, the oxidizer chamber was flushed with Argon at 10 CFH
<DD>  2)   Load the 3 wafers E,B,3 into the oven and flush for 10 minutes with Argon at 10 CFH
<DD>  3)    Heat for TWO hours at 800C with Argon flow at 2 CFH
<DD>  4)    Turn off heat -> temperature drops to 400C
<DD>  5)     1 hour later, SLOWLY pull out the tray over 45 min  period (open oven door after 35 min)
<DD>   6)    Finally, remove wafers and let sit at room temperature

<DT>  <U> D.   Wednesday group's work (need to add)...
