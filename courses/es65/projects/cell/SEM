<A HREF="BH.JPG">SEM</A> of impedance measuring device with two identical, complementary electrodes (designed by Bob Halk).  Each electrode has a fixed hinge assembly (middle) and a moving hinge.  On the right and left side of the picture are push rods which are mechanically actuated by the two rectangular fixtures attached to them above and below.  When pushed up, the two electrodes stand perpindicular to the substrate, with a sample to be placed in between them.  The dark coils in between the electrodes is a resistive heating coil which serves to vary the impedance measuring temperature.  The darker areas in the SEM are the polysilicon layers and the silicon substrate.  The gold conductive layer is white in the SEM.  The large white square near the bottom is one of the contact pads for the resistive heater.
