<b>Intellectual Focus</b>:  The science and technology of micro-structure design
and fabrication are introduced and explored in detail.  Lectures and homework
assignments will emphasize physical and chemical phenomena related to
micro-fabrication.  Laboratories during the first half of the course will
reinforce lectures by emphasizing the basics of micro-fabrication technology,
such as thin film growth and deposition, photolithography, wet and dry (plasma)
chemical etching, and materials characterization and evaluation.  These initial
lab exercises will use the facilities of the Solid State Microfabrication
Laboratory.  In the latter half of the course, a group design project is
required, wherein students in groups of two will design their own
micro-machines using available CAD tools.  Designs will subsequently be sent to
the Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) foundry service for
fabrication.  Upon return from MCNC, students will test and evaluate their
designs; grades will not be reported until this task is completed.<p>
<p>
Topics related to chemistry include:  semiconductor crystal growth; epitaxial
film deposition; oxidation and
nitridation of semiconductors; photoresist chemistry; wet chemical and dry
plasma etching of semiconductors, metals and insulators; and thin film vapor
deposition of these materials.  Topics related to physics include:  optics
related to small structure definition; ion implantation; point defect theory,
dopant diffusion processes and mechanisms; and electrical device behavior.
Both surface and bulk micro-machining will be studied in detail.  Processes
beyond the usual semiconductor microelectronic processes -- such as the LIGA
process, combining  electron beam lithography and electrodeposition -- will
also be presented.  As much as possible, the context of these micro-machining
processes, as manifested by products such as micro-sensors and micro-actuators,
will be emphasized.<p>
<p>
Concurrent with classroom work, students will design a micro-machine of their
own design, following the design rules specified by the MCNC process.  These
designs will be sent to MCNC for fabrication.  Upon their return during the
Winter quarter, students will complete their coursework by testing their
designs, using the micro-characterization facilities of the Solid State Lab.<p>
<b><p>
Reading</b>:  Readings will be assigned from the texts.  Additional source
books are available on reserve in Feldberg Library, or from my office
collection.  Please treat all library materials with the respect they deserve,
knowing that other students count on them as well.<p>
<b><p>
Homework: </b>Homework should be done <b>neatly and legibly</b>.    Homework
will tend to anticipate lecture material, as well as cover material already
presented.  <b>There is no penalty for late homework; however, it will not be
accepted later than one week after the initial due date</b>.  You are
encouraged to work together on homework; but, <u>remember to acknowledge any
help you receive</u>.<p>
<b><p>
Computing Environment</b>:  This course will make use of both Macintosh and UWE
(Unix Workstation Environment) resources for analytical, numerical, and CAD
work.  Layout tools such as <i>magic</i> and <i>L-Edit</i> will be introduced
and used extensively.  Process simulation tools such as SUPREM-III, SUPREM-IV,
and FLOOPS will be utilized.<p>
<b><p>
Laboratories, and Design Project Presentation/Report: </b>To explicate the
theoretical principles discussed in class, a variety of laboratory exercises
will be carried out in the Solid State Microfabrication Lab in Room 223
Cummings.  This clean room facility has been designed for both teaching and
research in the area of microelectronics and microstructures.  Students will be
trained in the principles underlying safe use of all chemicals and equipment
found in the lab.  They will then proceed, over the ten-week period of the
course, to fabricate the devices, making physical and electrical measurements
to characterize their progress.  <p>
<p>
The keystone of the course is the final project.  In groups of roughly four,
sttudents will define and execute the design of a micro-machine project.
Design activities will rely on the processes developed in 
<a href="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/thayer/programs/courses.html#ENGS21">Engineering Sciences 21 -- Introduction to Engineering</a>.
This design will then be submitted to the
Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, for fabrication using their
Multi-User Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) Process.  MUMPs is subsidized
by ARPA, the Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  A final
presentation and report will complete the work of the course during the winter
quarter.  Once MCNC has completed the microfabrication process, devices will be
returned for testing at Dartmouth.  Final grades will not be assigned until the
devices are evaluated, and a concluding report is submitted.<b><p>
