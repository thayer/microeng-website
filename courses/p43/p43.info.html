Discussion Preparation:      
<dd>For each Friday class, you must read the indicated material
and be ready to
summarize the key points.  You must also bring in writing
(<b>to be turned in)</b> a list of at least <b>two key points</b> made in the
reading at least <b>two  good questions on the material</b>.  The questions and
key points will form a base from which to start our discussion.  Critical
reading always raises  questions, and is an important part of learning.
<b>Think especially</b> about how this material may relate to material you have
seen in this and <u>other courses</u>, or to experiences you have in
<u>everyday life</u>.  Think about what various results mean in <u>extreme
limits</u>.  Examples of good questions:  eqn 2.2 looks like a binomial
coefficient; is there a relationship between this probability and a binomial
expansion?  or,  considering eqn. 1.5,  if T--&gt;0, does V vanish?--what
happens to the gas molecules if there is no volume?  Good questions usually
take some thought.  An example of a poor question is:  How does one get from
eqn x.y to eqn x.y+1 in the text (a better question would be:  I've worked out
the implications of eqn x.y, and I can only get x.y+1 by making assumption zz;
is this really necessary, and is it valid?).<p>

Honor Principle:	
<dd>It is expected that you have all read and understand the Academic
Honor Principle.  Note that you are bound to take some action if you witness an
apparent violation.  In the context of this course:<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Exams:	The following will be on each exam cover sheet:  "You are allowed to
bring in and use  a calculator and one 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper with whatever
notes you like on both sides.  You may not consult any other source or person
(except the instructor) during the exam."<p>
<p>
<li>
Homework &amp; Labs:	You may <b>not </b>directly <i>copy</i> another student's work.  You
may <b>not </b><i>consult</i> another student's work <i>without
their knowledge and permission</i>.  However, you
	<b>are encouraged</b> to consult with other students in the homework problem
solving process (this is facilitated by working in the same room; I'd suggest
210 Wilder).  You will learn the most by working as much as you can on your own
first, then consulting with others on the parts you or they can't get.  One
bottom line is this:  <b>in the end </b>(after any consultation)<b> you must be
able to work through on your own whatever you turn in.</b>  All lab data
reported must be your own.<p>
