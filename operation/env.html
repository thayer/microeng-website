<p>
<b>Symptom:  LOW TEMPERATURE (T&lt;65F)</b><p>
<b></b>It is imperative that the lab stay well above 32F to avoid freezing of
water lines and water based chemicals.  It is also very important to avoid
condensation on cold surfaces.  This is of particular concern because the
surface temperatures lag that of the air as the lab warms back up.
Condensation would result in contamination of all surfaces, including stock
silicon wafers and experiments in progress.<p>
<p>
<b>Cause 1:</b>  No steam or steam valve stuck shut.<p>
<p>
* SUMMER ONLY RESPONSE (outside T&gt;45F):   Notify one of the persons listed
below so that access to the lab can be limited.  Humidity may drop and static
sensitive operations should be avoided in the lab.  No other action is
necessary as long as temperature remains well above freezing.   The temperature
will probably stabilize at about 50F.  <b>When steam comes back on,  the
temperature should be increased</b> <b>SLOWLY</b> to avoid condensation on the
walls.  Humidity must be kept low enough to prevent condensation on room
surfaces, which may remain cool well after the air temperature increases.
For the conditions noted to the right, the lab walls and other surfaces must
have reached at least the indicated temperature in order to avoid condensation.
It is not easy to estimate how long it takes for surfaces to reach equilibrium;
if the room has  reached 50F, it should probably be brought up to 70F over a
period of at least an hour unless the RH is well below 50%.<p>

* WINTER ONLY RESPONSE  (outside T&lt;45F):  Turn off outside air damper.  The
resulting room pressure decrease will result in some contamination of the room,
but temperature should stay well above freezing.  Notify one of the persons
listed below so access to the lab can be limited (to minimize contamination and
for safety under reduced flow).  Also see NOTE 1 at the end of this document.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Symptom:  HIGH TEMPERATURE (T&gt;75F)</b><p>
<b></b>The lab temperature should not exceed 75F for any extended period,  and
must never exceed 100F.  There are processes in the lab which are very
temperature sensitive (e.g. developing photoresist), and there are chemicals,
gaskets, and fittings in the lab which can degrade or fail at elevated
temperatures.  If the temperature in the supply ducts exceeds 160F, the fire
dampers will close, shutting down most of the airflow into the lab.<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Cause 1:</b>  NO CONTROL LINE AIR PRESSURE<p>
Loss of control air pressure will cause the steam valve in the lab supply to
open fully.<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: <b> Immediate</b> manual shutoff of building steam is called for.
[As an alternative to turning off steam to the entire building, there are two
manual valves on the lines entering the AC6 McQuay handler; notify the building
manager and the lab manager if these are valved off].  When temperature drops
back below 65F,  either continue manual control or treat as a low temperature
condition. Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab can
be limited.  NOTE:  The temperature in the lab will rise much faster than that
in the building.  This can be a serious condition; in one recent case where the
temperature reached well over 100 F, pressure lines  popped off of fittings,
squirt bottles dispensed solvents and caustic chemicals,  containers of
concentrated acid bulged  and deformed (perhaps nearly bursting), and the fire
dampers were tripped.   We hope soon to have an automated response to this
extreme condition.<p>
<p>
<b>Cause 2: </b> NO COOLANT<p>
If coolant is lost in the summer, the temperature may rise to the outside
temperature.  This is not a severe problem, though the resulting high humidity
can be.  Condensation on the lab walls must be avoided.<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE:  Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab
can be limited.   Discontinue humidification until coolant is restored (the
resulting low humidity is preferable to a high dew point).<p>
* if temperature increases above outside temperature:  follow the response to
"no control line pressure"  (cause 1 above).<p>

* a rapid increase in temperature without a decrease in RH could lead to
condensation.  For the conditions noted to the right, the lab walls and other
surfaces must be above indicated temperature in order to avoid condensation.
These surfaces lag the room temperature.  <b>If conditions are approaching
condensation, close the outside air damper</b>.  The resulting room pressure
decrease will result in some contamination of the room, but the humidity should
not continue to increase.   Also see NOTE 1 at the end of this document.<p>
<p>
<b>Cause 3:</b>  STEAM LEAK INTO ROOM<p>
In this case both temperature and humidity may increase catastrophically, with
very serious repercussions.<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: <b> <u>Immediate</u></b>  shutoff of steam is imperative.  If
remote control is not effective, manual shutoff of building steam is necessary.
 [As an alternative to turning off steam to the entire building, there are two
manual valves on the lines entering the AC6 McQuay handler; notify the building
manager and the lab manager if these are valved off].  When temperature drops

It is important to avoid condensation in the lab; condensation may result in
contamination of all surfaces including silicon wafers.  Note that the
temperature of the laboratory surfaces and walls lags behind and may be lower
than the ambient lab air temperature.  The chart to the right shows some
conditions under which condensation will occur.<p>
<p>
<b>Cause 1:</b>  COOLANT CROSSOVER:  Crossover  from evaporative cooling to
refrigeration involves a temporary increase in cooling water temperature.  This
limits the cooling and humidity extraction capacity of the McQuay handler, AC6.
 Crossover may occur more than once a day in the spring and fall.<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE:  Watch to ensure the transient humidity and temperature rise are
not extreme; the temperature of the lab surfaces (assumed here to be at 70 F)
must remain above the dew point of the lab air.  If dew formation is imminent,
shut outside damper and notify one of the persons listed below so that
sensitive surfaces can be protected and access limited.   The resulting room
pressure decrease will result in  some contamination of the room, but
condensation will be avoided.  Also see NOTE 1 at the end of this document. <p>
<p>
<b>Cause 2:</b>  COMPLETE COOLANT LOSS<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE:   Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab
can be limited.   Watch to ensure transient humidity and temperature rise are
not extreme; the temperature of the lab surfaces (assumed here to be at 70F)
must remain above the dew point of the lab air.  If dew formation is imminent,
shut outside damper, and notify one of the persons listed below so that
sensitive surfaces can be protected and access limited.   The resulting room
pressure decrease will result in  some contamination of the room, but
condensation will be avoided.  <p>
  <p>
<b>Cause 3:</b>  STEAM LEAK INTO ROOM<p>

very serious repercussions.<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: <b> <u>Immediate</u></b>  shutoff of steam is imperative (if remote
control is not effective, manual shutoff of building steam is necessary).
When temperature drops back below 65F, treat as a low temperature condition.
Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab can be
limited.  We hope soon to have an automated response to this extreme
condition.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Symptom:  LOW HUMIDITY (RH &lt;30%)</b><p>
The major concern here is with devices sensitive to static electricity and with
photoresist spin-on.  Lab users need to be notified so they can take
appropriate precautions.<p>
<p>
<b>Cause 1:</b> LOSS OF STEAM<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab
can be limited,  sensitive processes avoided.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Symptom:  LOW PRESSURE (room to building &lt; 0.04 inches for &gt; 5
min.)</b><p>
The concern here is with contamination.  A pressure below that of the building
is especially bad, as it draws airborne contamination into the lab.  If such an
under pressure condition exists for several hours, it may take a day or longer
to recover clean conditions.  A low pressure condition  may also be an
indication of other serious problems.<p>
<p>
<b>Cause 1:</b> OUTSIDE DAMPER CLOSED<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab
can be limited.  If the damper has been closed to solve another problem
condition, continue to follow the protocol for that condition.  Otherwise check
the computer control and investigate for damper malfunction.  Also see NOTE 1
at the end of this document. <p>
<p>
<b>Cause 2:</b>  FIRE DAMPERS CLOSED<p>
This may happen if there is a temperature extreme well  in excess of 100 F in
the lab (and in excess of 160F at the damper).<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: Notify one of the persons listed below so that access to the lab
can be limited.  The dampers must be reset.  Also see NOTE 1 at the end of this
document. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Symptom: POWER LOSS</b><p>
<b></b>Power loss results in the loss of pressure, temperature, and humidity
control, and the loss of fume hood venting.  All persons should leave the lab
immediately.  Toxic and/or corrosive fumes may be present in the lab.  The lab
is susceptible to contamination from building air, and no lab entries should be
made while power is off.<p>
<p>
* RESPONSE: Notify one of the persons listed below so that the lab may be
evacuated and access limited.   Continue with the instructions below when power
is restored.<p>
<p>
* POWERUP RESPONSE FOR MOMENTARY OUTAGE:  If the power outage is reasonably
short (say less than 10 minutes), startup should be straight forward.  Check
that the cooling water is restored and all blowers start up (watch for a
tripped breaker in the wall box near AC6).<p>
  <p>
* POWERUP RESPONSE FOR EXTENDED OUTAGE:  When power is restored after being off
for more than a few minutes, the proper sequence of events is essential in
order to avoid further problems (overheating, condensation and contamination).
The problem is that cooling water will not be immediately available (after the
lubricating oil is up to temperature, it takes 16 minutes to restart the
system, but if the power has been off for an extended period, it can take a
couple of hours for the oil to reheat).  The lack of cooling can cause
overheating and/or condensation, depending on the outside conditions and how
much outside air is drawn in.<p>
<p>
* If the outside temperature is below about 95 F <p>
  <b>AND</b> <p>
* if the outside dew point is below about 65 F, <p>
then ordinary startup is OK.  The blowers will start as soon as power is
restored; if not, check for a tripped breaker in the wall box near AC6.
Cooling water may not be available for several hours, and the lab temperature
may rise, but the pressure will be normal, and contamination controlled.<p>
<p>
* If the outside temperature is above about 95 F <p>
<b>  OR </b><p>
* if the outside dew point is above about 65F, <p>
then the outside damper should be shut until cooling water is restored.  This
will keep hot and moist outside air out of the cool room, and thus limit the
temperature rise an risk of condensation.  However, this is at the expense of
loss in room pressure.  Entry to the lab must be limited until cooling has been
restored the outside damper opened, and pressure returned to normal.   The
blowers will start as soon as power is restored; if not, check for a tripped
breaker in the wall box near AC6.  Also see NOTE 1 at the end of this
document.<p>
<p>
<b>NOTE 1:  </b>WHEN OUTSIDE DAMPER MUST BE SHUT:<p>
If the fume hood and service corridor exhaust fans continue to run while the
outside "makeup air" damper is shut, the room pressure will go below building
pressure (in the long run, the best solution to this problem would be to add
another source of makeup air).  Under special circumstances (for example, when
contamination would be catastrophic for an important experiment), the solid
state  lab manager may decide to power down the fume hood and service corridor
exhaust fans until the outside damper can be reopened.  With these fans off,
the room will remain at building pressure rather than going below building
pressure.  While this is advantageous, it is not to be standard practice
because it compromises safety--without the fume hood exhaust fans, if there are
open containers in the hoods, fumes may enter the lab. Thus these fans should
be powered back up as soon as possible; were the exhaust fans to be forgotten
and left off, subsequent lab users would have no protection in the hoods.  This
would be a very serious breach of safety.   It is the responsibility of  the
person who turns them off to verify that they have been powered back up.
During the time these fans are off and for an hour after that, there must be a
sign posted on the doors :   "Fume hood and lab exhaust disabled--DO NOT ENTER"
