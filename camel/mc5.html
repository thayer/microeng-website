<H1>2. Non-parameterized Micromechanical Element Library</H1>
<P>The non parameterized element library is a resource of working MEMS
devices and structures. The intent is to provide the novice MEMS
designer  easy access to MEMS designs without having to extract
information from  references and reinvent the wheel. This chapter
explains how to use the  non parameterized cell library. Section 2.1
describes how to browse  and retrieve cells from the library database.
The browser allows the user  to peruse a brief description of cells and
select desired ones. Section 2.2   details how users can submit their
own designs for addition to the library  once they have been fabricated
and tested. While this may be unimportant  to the novice user, we hope
that experienced MEMS designers will contribute  generously to the
library as it is paramount to the success of the library.  Section 2.3
and Section 2.4 describe some of the cells currently available  in the
library. The programs used are written in the Practical Extraction  and
Report Language, perl. Thus, perl must be available on the machine on
which the library programs are installed.</P>

<P>A simple perl script, <I>DBRetrieve,</I> is available for
cell  retrieval. It can be accessed electronically via ftp using the
following  steps:</P>
<PRE>ftp mcnc.org
Name: anonymous
Password: ident
cd pub/MEMS/NPCaMEL
get DBRetrieve
quit
</PRE>
<P>This directory also includes a file named README.DBRead that
provides  further information about the installation procedure. To run
the program  type <TT>DBRetrieve</TT> and the rest should be
self-explanatory.
<I>DBRetrieve</I> is written in perl and utilizes a shell forms program
 called sf. The program will query the user for the cells desired then
send mail to MCNC's cell library manager, which then extracts the design
 or designs and sends the layouts to the user. Designs are emailed to
the  user in either the CIF (CalTech Intermediate Form) or GDS II mask
format.
</P>
<P><I>DBRetrieve</I> prompts the user for the mask format desired and
browsing category. Designs may be browsed according to the process
technology or the device design category. It is anticipated that the
majority of designs will be for the MCNC MUMPs processes; however, the
software is designed to include other processes as well. The design
categories are currently test devices, motors, out-of-plane structures,
linear actuators, and a miscellaneous category. Once these queries have
been answered a sorted list will appear as shown in Figure 1.</P>

<H2><A NAME="2.2">2.2 Cell Entry</A></H2>
<P><I>DBSubmit</I> is a program used to automate the submission of
MEMS  cells to the MCNC - ARPA cell library. It is written in perl and
is designed  to be easy to use. The first time the program is run it
prompts the user for  information about the designer, fabrication
process, and design and sets up  a template file. This template file can
then be edited and used for subsequent submissions. The program, <B><I>DBSubmit</I></B>,
can be retrieved in the  same manner as described in Section 2.1. It is
also located in
<I>pub/MEMS/NPCaMEL</I>and the file README.DBSubmit provides
installation  information.</P>
<P>In order to use this program, the <B>$DB_PROC</B> variable in the
script  must be set correctly. It should be set to the directory
containing the  database of process information. An updated set of this
information can be  obtained via anonymous ftp as explained below. If
the directory variable is  not set correctly, a directory named<B>./DB_PROC</B>
is created  automatically. New processes can easily be added by the user
within the  framework of the program. To set up the process database
directory, first  create a directory <B>$PATH/dir</B> for the data.
Then obtain the process  information via ftp using:</P>
<PRE>cd $PATH/dir
ftp -i mcnc.org
Name: anonymous
Password: ident
cd pub/MEMS/NPCaMEL/DB_PROC
mget *
quit
cd ..
</PRE>
<P>Before running the program <B><I>DBSubmit, </I></B>create a CIF or
 GDS II file with the mask layout of the design to be submitted. Do not
forget to include definitions of any leaf cells that are called as
instances within the main cell. <B><I>DBSubmit</I></B> is a forms
based  script that prompts the user for a number of items including
name, address,  cell descriptions, etc. Once the forms are filled out,
the software will  send the information to MCNC where the cell is
entered in the library  database and made available to domestic users. A
file named
<B><I>cell_name.sbmt </I></B>is saved in the user's directory and can
be  used for subsequent submissions by modifying the file and typing
<B>DBSubmit cell_name.sbmt</B>. An example of a submission file is
shown  below with comments added after the pound (#) symbol.</P>

<H3><A NAME="2.4.5">2.4.5  Simple Hinge</A></H3>
<PRE>NAME: simple_hinge
Cell NAME: simple_hinge, (MUMPS3)
SIZE: 	Cell Width: 30 	Cell Height: 33
DESCRIPTION: This is the standard hinge that we use to rotate structures
             out of the plane of fabrication. Hinge pin is 2um wide poly1.

Yield: Device yield is probably better than 99%. Structure yield can be
       substantially lower (e.g. 0%) depending upon the complexity of the
       structure. In some cases it _is_ the hinges that actually fail,
       but this is typically due to a bad structure design.

Device Performance: In general the hinge performance in MUMPS3 is
       acceptable, with some caveats. Due to undercut of poly1, a wider
       hinge pin may be desirable (3 um drawn seems to work ok). The poly 1
       thickness is comparable to the ox1+ox2 thicknesses, leading to
       potential problems with the hinge pin sliding under the edges of
       the staple and breaking during assembly. If a bit of caution is
       used during assembly, these problems can be avoided.
