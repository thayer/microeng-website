<H1>5. Passive Micromechanical Elements</H1> 
<P>The passive micromechanical elements available in the Parameterized 
Micromechanical Element library are described in this chapter. Again, 
there are two versions of most elements implemented on each of the first
 and second structural layers. In some cases, like <B>bearing2</B>, the
 element is designed to mechanically interface with a rotary element on 
structural layer 2 and consists of structures on both structural layers.
 The geometrical parameters passed to the generators use the following 
units: µm for length dimensions and degrees for angles. For other design
 parameters, the units used are specified in the description of the 
element.</P>
<P>The following passive elements are currently available in the CaMEL 
PME library:</P>

<H2><A NAME="5.1">5.1 Journal Bearing Element: bearing1</A></H2>
<P>The <B>bearing1</B> PME generator generates a journal bearing
intended  to connect with a rotary element on the first structural
layer. The shaft  anchored to the substrate, and the retaining cap on
top of the shaft central  to the bearing are formed on the second
structural layer. The design  parameters are:</P>
<PRE>
  rcap:    radius of cap on central shaft, µm
  rinner:  inner radius of journal rotor, µm
  router:  outer radius of journal rotor, µm
  name:    name of cell. 
</PRE>
<P>The outside of the shaft on structural layer 2 is one bearing
surface  while the inside of the rotor on structural layer 1 is the
second bearing  surface. The clearance between the two bearing surfaces
is determined by  the thickness of the second sacrificial layer used in
the surface  micromachining fabrication process. The radius of the shaft
is set by the  inner radius of the journal rotor and the second
sacrificial layer thickness  used in the process. The origin of the cell
is located at the center of the  shaft and cap.</P>

the shaft  and rotor is determined by the second sacrificial layer. The
substrate is  not shown in the cross section; the layers shown are:

layer, and second  structural layer.</P> 
<H2><A NAME="5.2">5.2 Journal Bearing Element: bearing2</A></H2>

</PRE>
<P>The outside of the shaft on structural layer 2 is one bearing
surface  while the inside of the rotor on structural layer 1 is the
second bearing  surface. The clearance between the two bearing surfaces
is determined by  the thickness of the second sacrificial layer. The
radius of the shaft is  set by the inner radius of the journal rotor and
the second sacrificial  layer thickness used in the process. The rotor
has an outer ring on  structural layer 2 that is mechanically connected
to the rotary part of  the bearing on structural layer 1. The origin of
the cell is located at  the center of the shaft and cap.</P>
