<H1>1.  Introduction</H1>
<P>This manual describes the Consolidated Micromechanical Element Library, 
<B>CaMEL</B>. The library consists of two independent parts; the 
<I>nonparameterized</I> cell database and the <I>parameterized</I> 
microelectromechanical element library, PME. The aim is to provide MEMS 
cell libraries that are not only useful for novice MEMS designers, but to 
experienced ones as well. Both libraries are intended to assist the user 
in the design and layout of MEMS devices by providing an initial layout 
for components of a MEMS system. It is assumed that the user will modify 
these elements and customize them as desired and assemble designs using a 
suitable mask layout editor (the layout editor must support non-rectangular 
geometries).</P>
<P>The nonparameterized cell library is a database of MEMS designs in various 
process technologies contributed by different sources. Further design 
contributions from the MEMS community for addition to the library are 
actively solicited! (See Chapter 2 for details.) The nonparameterized 
library tools are written using the Practical Extraction and Report Language, 
perl. Perl can be obtained via ftp from the Free Software Foundation at 
prep.ai.mit.edu. Layout for cells in the library is available in Caltech 
Intermediate Form (CIF) and GDS II formats.</P>
<P>The PME library includes a set of generators that can be used to create 
customized layout for many common MEMS components that use a surface 
micromachined process technology such as the MUMPS process. Technology 
specific design rules are used to ensure that the layout will conform to 
process requirements. The generators support CIF and  GDS II mask formats, 
as well as PostScript for viewing or printing purposes. The library 
framework can also be used to write customized generators for other process 
technolgies. The PME library is currently available on Sun-Sparc and HP 
workstation platforms.</P>
<P>Bug reports, suggestions, and contributions are actively solicited and 
should be sent to <I>camel@mcnc.org.</I></P>
