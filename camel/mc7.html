<H1>4.  Active Micromechanical Elements</H1>
<P>This chapter describes the various active micromechanical elements
available in the Parameterized Micromechanical Element library. In most
cases, there are two versions of the element which are similar except
for  the structural layer used. Elements using the first structural
layer are  designated by a 1 in the name of the element, while those on
the second  structural layer are designated with a 2 in the name. For
example,
<B>lcomb1</B> designates a linear comb drive on structural layer 1
while
<B>lcomb2</B> generates a linear comb drive on structural layer 2. The
geometrical parameters passed to the generators are in the following
units:  µm for length dimensions and degrees for angles. For other
design  parameters, the units used are specified in the description of
the  element.</P>
<P>The following active elements are currently available in the CaMEL
PME  library:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Harmonic Side Drives - hsdm1, hsdm2
</LI>
<LI>Linear Comb Drives - lcomb1, lcomb2
</LI>
<LI>Linear Side Drives - lsdm1, lsdm2
</LI>
<LI>Rotary Comb Drives - rcdm1, rcdm2, rcombd1, rcombd2, rcombu1,
rcombu2, rcombu1a, rcombu2a
</LI>
<LI>Rotary Side Drives - rsdm1, rsdm2
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The element calling sequence for each generator shows the sequence
and  data type of arguments required by the element. Variable and
function data  types shown in bold letters are for information purposes
and should be kept  in mind if the library functions are called directly
from a C program. They  do not have to be explicity included in the
input file under normal usage by  the average user.</P>
