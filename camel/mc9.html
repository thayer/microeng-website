<H1>6. Test and Electrical Micromechanical Elements</H1>
<P>Various mechanical and electrical test and measurement structures
are  available in the Parameterized Micromechanical Element library and
are  described in this chapter. Where appropriate, there are versions of
the  element implemented on each of the structural layers. All
geometrical  length parameters passed to the generators must be in µm
units. Test  structres such as the Guckel rings and Euler columns can be
used to  estimate the residual stress in the structural layers.</P>
<P>The following test and electrical elements are currently available
in the CaMEL PME library:</P>

<P>Some of the test structure elements include mechanical models of the
 structures within them in order to allow mechanical parameters as
inputs  to the element. It is also necessary to enter process dependent
material  properties and layer thicknesses in order to allow these
mechanical models  to be used.</P>

<H2><A NAME="6.4">6.4 Euler Column (Doubly Supported Beam) Elements:
dsbeam1, dsbeam2</A></H2>
<P>The <B>dsbeam1</B> and <B>dsbeam2</B> PME elements generate doubly
 supported beam test structures. This element can be used to estimate
the residual strain in a film with a compressive residual strain.
Generally, an array of beams with varying lengths are used to determine
the critical buckling length for the residual strain in the structural
layer of interest. Hence, the name, Euler columns, for these test
structures. The origin of the cell is located at the center of the
beam. The following parameters are used:</P>
<PRE>
  blength:  length of doubly supported beam, µm
  bwidth:   width of doubly supported beam, µm
  asize:    size of anchor supports, µm
  name:     name of cell.
</PRE>
<P>The beam parameters are chosen to set the critical buckling strain
of  the beam and hence the residual compressive strain that it would
detect.  If the thickness of the structural layer used is larger than
the width of  the beam, lateral buckling will occur; i.e., buckling in
the plane of the  wafer. Otherwise, buckling will occur out of the plane
of the wafer.</P>

strain value at which the beam will buckle upon release is determined

dimension of the beam.</P>
<H2><A NAME="6.5">6.5 Array of Euler Column Elements: dsbeams1,
dsbeams2</A></H2>
<P>The <B>dsbeams1</B> and <B>dsbeams2</B> PME elements generate sets
 of doubly supported beam test structures on structural layer 1 and
structural layer 2, respectively. This element can be used to estimate
the residual strain in a film with a compressive residual strain
<A HREF="c9.html#FN1">(1)</A>. The origin of the cell is located at the
 left end of the set of beams. The following parameters are used:</P>
<PRE>
  e0min:   minimum residual strain
  e0max:   maximum residual strain
  dele0:   residual strain step size
  bwidth:  width of doubly supported beam, µm
  height:  thickness of structural layer of the beam, µm
  asize:   size of anchor supports, µm
  name:    name of cell.
</PRE>
<P>The element uses the residual strain range and step size specified
to  determine the beam lengths of the array of doubly supported beams.
The  lengths are chosen such that the critical strain that the beams can
 support before buckling corresponds to the desired value of residual
strain to be detected. For beams clamped at both ends, the Euler
buckling criterion for the compressive strain in the film </P>
<PRE>	<A HREF="c9.eq.1.gif"><IMG SRC="c9.eq.1.gif"></A></PRE>
<P>is used, where <I>L</I> is the length, and <I>h</I> the height of
the  beam (the minimum of bwidth and height parameters specified). The
anchored  ends of the beam are considered ideal clamped ends and the
elasticity of  the supports is not modelled. The beam parameters are
chosen to set the  critical buckling strain of the beam and hence the
residual compressive  strain that it would detect. If the thickness of
the structural layer used  is larger than the width of the beam, lateral
buckling will occur; i.e.,  buckling in the plane of the wafer.
Otherwise, buckling will occur out of  the plane of the wafer.</P>

<P>The <B>gring1</B> and <B>gring2</B> elements generate a single
"Guckel" ring test structure on structural layer 1 and  structural layer
2, respectively. These ring structures can be used  to estimate the
residual strain in a film with tensile residual strain.  An array of
rings with different radii are used to estimate the critical  radius at
which buckling occurs in the cross beam of the test structure  and hence
infer the tensile residual stress present in the structural  film. The
origin of the element is located at the center of the ring.  The
following parameters are used:</P>
<PRE>
  radius:  mean radius of ring, µm
  bring:   width of ring, µm
  bbeam:   width of cross beam, µm
  asize:   size of anchor supports, µm
  name:    name of cell.
</PRE>
<P>The ring parameters are chosen to set the critical buckling strain
of  the cross beam and hence the residual tensile strain that it would
detect.  If the thickness of the structural layer used is larger than
