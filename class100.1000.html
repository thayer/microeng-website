A cleanroom is an environment where airborn particulates are controlled
through an exchange of highly filtered air, and through minimization of
activities that generate particles.  For example, a  special
<a href="map/gowning.html">gowning procedure</a> is required prior to
entering the cleanroom. 
<ul>
<li>
A <strong>class 100</strong> cleanroom maintains less than one hundred
particles larger than 0.5 microns in each cubic foot of air space.  
It is equivalent to ISO class 5 cleanroom.
<br>This cleanroom has 250 square feet of class 100 space available.
<p>
<li>
A <strong>class 1000</strong> cleanroom has less than 1000 such
particles per cubic foot. It is equivalent to an ISO class 6 cleanroom. 
<br>This cleanroom has 600 square feet of class 1000 space available.
</ul>
In addition to particle control, the cleanroom is <strong>temperature</strong>
and <strong>humidity</strong> controlled to <strong>70F, 50% RH</strong>.

<a href="operation/env.html">Protocols</a> help mantain the best
possible environmental conditions when something goes wrong with
the air handling systems.

A comparison between Federal Standard 209 E classification and 1999 ISO 14644-1
classification schemes is given
