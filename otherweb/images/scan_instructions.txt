On the computer in Bosworth attached to the Color OneScanner:

1)  Open the application Ofoto--it's on the hard drive.  Two windows will immediately 
open:  Untitled 1 and Scan Controls. 

2)  Place your picture face down on the scanner.  

3)  In the Scan Controls window:

    	Set Calibration to Laser Writer IINT.
	Choose Manual instead of Auto.
	Adjust Scan DPI and Print DPI as you desire.

		NOTE:  the higher the DPI you choose, the more memory your scan will 
		use and the difference in quality of scan is slight.  I recommend using 100 
		or 135 for both scan DPI and print DPI.  Adjusting the bits, however, 
		causes drastic changes.  I recommend leaving both the scan bits and the 
		print bits at 8:G.  

4)  Click on Prescan--scan of your image should appear in the Untitled window.

5)  Go to Image on the top menu bar to straighten, sharpen, focus, rotate, flip or invert 
your scan as needed.

6)  Adjust dotted-line box to surround only that which you would like included in your 
scan.

7)  In Scan Controls window, click on Scan.  More detailed scan of selected material will 
appear in Untitled window.

8)  Use Image again to make final changes.  Resizing is available under Image, as well as 
previously mentioned capabilities.  To crop without rescanning, select preferred area to 
scan with the dotted-line box and go to Edit/Crop.

9)  If top left corner of Untitled window says Rescan Recommended, click again on Scan 
in the Scan Controls window.  

10)  To save, go to File/Save.  Choose the file format you would like to save as--probably 
PICT or TIFF.

11)  To do another scan, go to File/New and begin with step #1.


		NOTE:  for color scans, choose a calibration such that color photo is 
		selected.  There are a few that work.  Leave Auto selected instead of 
		changing to Manual and perform the rest of the steps as stated above.
