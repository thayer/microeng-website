During scans of DRAM cells, the probe tip came close enough to the surface
of the sample to deposit charge on oxide.  The effect of this static charge
is clearly seen in all three measurement modes.  The charge has the most
impact upon the EPD signal due to the lateral bending of surface energy bands
in addition to the long range effects described earlier.
