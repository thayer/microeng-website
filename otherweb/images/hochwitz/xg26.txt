Images from scans of boron doped squares in a silicon substrate.  The vdW
images show the etched surface from the wafer processing, and correspond
to the size of the implant window (outlined in green on the lower images).
The top set of images shows what appears to be a loop dislocation, colored
with the diffusion of dopants out of the implant area.  The bottom set of
images shows the EPD signal has larger effective area, due to the convolution
effect and lateral diffusion of the implanted dopants.
