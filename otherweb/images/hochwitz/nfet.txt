The SKPM may also be used to image dopant profiles in semiconductors.  The
scans shown above are from attempts to image dopant profiles in an n-channel
MOSFET.  The sample was stripped down to bare silicon.  The raised areas in
the vdW signal are channels of two adjacent transistors.  The lower areas
are source/drain implants, and via remnants may be seen.  The EPD signal
clearly shows the doped regions of the source/drain.  There is also a ridge
seen in the transition between source/drain and channel, which we attribute
to LDD.  Two anomalous features were also imaged in the channel of one
transistor, but we have not attributed them to any specific electrical
feature as of this time.
