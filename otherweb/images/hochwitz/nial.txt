Images from scans of an alloy of nickel and aluminum.  The alloy has been
doped with boron for analysis with TEM.  The vdW signal indicates a surface
with very little relief other than a small crack in the top right corner.
In comparison to an SEM scan, the EPD images clearly show the grains of the
alloy.  The dark spots imaged are the boron impurities. Similar variations
in WFD due to grain orientation have been imaged with copper, nickel, and
poly-silicon.
