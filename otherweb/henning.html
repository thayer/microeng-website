Al Henning is Adjunct Associate Professor of Engineering.
From 1987 through 1995, he was Assistant, and then Associate, Professor in both
the Engineering Sciences Department at <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a>, and in the
<a href="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/thayer/">Thayer School of Engineering</a> at Dartmouth.  He founded, and directed, the
<a href="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/levey/ssml/home.html">Solid State Microengineering Laboratory</a> at Thayer School, a Class 100/1000
cleanroom facility for microelectronics and micro-machines (devices and materials) research and
teaching.
