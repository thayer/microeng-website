The <a href="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/levey/ssml/home.html">Solid State Microengineering Laboratory</a>
</i> at Dartmouth College,
completed in 1990, is a Class 100/1000 (lithography/general processing) clean
room. The lab is used for teaching and research in microelectronic and
micromachine fabrication, at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The
SSL is directed by Professor Albert Henning and is managed full-time by Dr.
Christopher Levey.<p>
<i><p>
The <a href="http://www.mcnc.org/HTML/ETD/MEMS/memshome.html">Microelectronics Center of North Carolina</a>
</i> (MCNC) and <i><a href="http://nitride.eecs.berkeley.edu:8001/">Analog Devices,
Inc.</a></i> have recently been funded by the federal government to serve as
microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) foundries. Each accepts CAD designs from
U.S. companies and universities. The designs are fabricated and then returned
to the originators for evaluation. The workshop will make use of these
facilities for the final student design projects. Once fabricated, these
projects will be returned to students at their home institutions for
evaluation.<p>
<i><p>
UWE (Unix Workstation Environment)</i> is a campus-wide, centrally administered network of over
250 engineering workstations for high-powered computing, design, and analysis.
