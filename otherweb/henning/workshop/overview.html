of Micromachines</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
This workshop is targeted for minority undergraduate majors in science and
engineering, to prepare them for both graduate degree programs and employment
in the rapidly evolving field of micromachine engineering and technology. It is
particularly intended to prepare students to make leading and lifelong
contributions to this field.<p>
<p>
The workshop will emphasize creativity in engineering design through execution
of advanced design projects. Construction of simpler micromachines in the
microfabrication laboratory will provide hands-on engineering experience.
Networking with guest lecturers and other visitors from industry and academe
will expose participants to the state of the art in micromachine science.<p>
<p>
Recommended prerequisites for the workshop include a year of introductory
calculus and physics, and one semester of chemistry. Participants will
typically enter their junior or senior year following the workshop.<p>
<p>
Three days a week, mornings will be spent on lectures and discussion,
afternoons will be spent on lab work, and guest speakers will be featured after
dinner. The other two days will be reserved for field trips.
