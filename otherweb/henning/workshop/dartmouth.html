<a href="http://caligari.dartmouth.edu/thayer/">Thayer School</a> emphasizes engineering fundamentals and student creativity: the
hands-on laboratory courses stress individual design and experimentation.
Students also benefit from accessible professors and a low student:faculty
ratio (~12:1).<p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu">Dartmouth College</a> is located in Hanover, New Hampshire, along the Connecticut
River and astride the Appalachian Trail.  It is a small university, with 4000
undergraduates, and 1000 graduate students in business, engineering, medicine,
music, and the sciences. Undergraduates attend classes during their sophomore
summer, creating an active campus year-round. The libraries hold over 2 million
volumes. Dartmouth pioneered the use of computers in the undergraduate
curriculum, and the Kiewit Computation Center remains the hub of such activity.

Recreational facilities include running tracks, tennis courts, an Olympic-size
pool, and facilities for basketball, gymnastics, dance, squash, racquetball,
fencing, riflery, volleyball, crew, and, of course, weight-training. Outdoors,
the Connecticut River offers kayaking, swimming, and canoeing. There are also
unlimited opportunities locally for hiking and mountain biking.<p>
<p>
The Hopkins Center and the Hood Museum offer a broad range of cultural and
social activities including theater, dance, music, films, and lectures. The
Hood houses Dartmouth's fine art collections as well as traveling exhibits.
