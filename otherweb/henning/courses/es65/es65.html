ENGS 65: Science and Technology of Micro-Machines<p>

Alternate years. 95W: 10A; Laboratory<p>

The science and technology of micro-structure design and fabrication are introduced
and explored in detail. Lectures and homework assignments will emphasize physical
and chemical phenomena related to micro-fabrication. Laboratories during the first
half of the course will reinforce lectures by emphasizing the basics of
micro-fabrication technology, such as thin film growth and deposition,
photolithography, wet and dry (plasma) chemical etching, and materials
characterization and evaluation. These initial lab exercises will use the facilities of
the solid state microfabrication laboratory at Thayer School. In the latter half of the
course, a group design project is required in which students will design their own
micro-machines using available CAD tools. Designs will subsequently be sent to the
Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) foundry service for fabrication.
Upon return from MCNC, students will test and evaluate their designs; grades will
not be reported until this task is completed. <p>
