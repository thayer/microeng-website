<H3>Abstract</H3>
The super-exponential growth in the base of information creators and users with access to the Internet makes possible a variety of schemes for the creation, organization, dissemination and revision of information over the Internet.  In this work, the ramifications of this technology for academic publishing, particularly in the engineering sciences, are explored.  Frameworks are proposed which enable and encourage dynamic authoring and retrieval of information that, in the past, would have been associated with a textbook.  A case study of the concept's application to an undergraduate course in engineering systems analysis is presented.

<H2><A NAME="intro">Introduction</A></H2>

<P>  In the span of a very few years, we have all crossed the watershed of information production and delivery using the technological bridges of the Internet, and ubiquitous information browsers such as Mosaic.  The paths leading outward from this new shore are innumerable.  Here, we describe one path for creating, organizating, disseminating and revising information, using these bridges and their present and future companions.  While the path is general, we will discuss it in the particular context of university-level science and engineering education, and give a specific example in terms of the topic of <i>Engineering Systems</i> at Dartmouth College.

<P>  Conventional science and engineering courses in colleges and universities revolve around a set of lectures, homeworks, exams, laboratory exercises, and usually a textbook.  Frequently, though less so of late, the textbook is the prime focus of the course.  Lectures tend to follow the table of contents of the textbook.  Homework is assigned verbatim from the text.  Instructors rely on the published solutions to the homework.

<P>  Despite some past success, there are considerable problems with this model of instruction.  While some students and faculty appreciate the permanence of a textbook, others find it constricting.  Cost increases in textbooks have far outstripped inflation over the past twenty years, leading to text prices in the sciences and engineering in the range of $100.  Too many students purchase a textbook, use it briefly during a quarter or semester, then sell the book, typically back to the bookstore from which it was purchased.

<P>  There is another drawback to the conventional means of authoring and publishing textbooks, which hinders the process of teaching and learning.  Contemporary authors exercise an unfortunate tendency to exert conscious, complete control over the content and presentation of their writing.  Typically, an author will insist on a specific, linear order of presentation of material, with each section fixed and immutable.  We refer to this insistence as the "Outer Limits Syndrome":  the desire to "control the vertical and the horizontal", forcing the reader to assume a passive posture in the learning process.

<P>  The intrinsic hubris of this tendency stems from two fallacies.   The first fallacy is that one author, or even several authors, can 'know it all'.  Most teachers (and students) know this to be false.  Even in the most tradition-bound institutions or courses, teachers will add supplemental notes, or depart regularly from the sequence of a textbook.  The reasons for these departures vary, but include a desire to establish personal control over the course material.  A need to adjust the textbook to suit the local curriculum may also dictate departures.  Or, an instructor may wish to prevent students from succumbing to the othodoxy of a textbook, thus losing the edge of critical and independent thinking.

<P>  The second fallacy is that students are empty, passive slates, upon which the author writes with the chalk of knowledge.  Again, students and teachers know this assumption is untrue.  Formal student feedback concerning the quality of every aspect of a course of instruction is gathered at the end of many courses in the sciences and engineering across the country.  These evaluations become useful in improving a course, and assisting its positive evolution.  In every aspect <i>except</i> the textbook, changes can be wrought in time to create improvements for the next presentation of the course.  Textbooks, however, must await completion of the slow process of producing a revised edition.  Frequently, even in this instance, the revised edition suffers from little substantive, direct feedback from the most intimate users of the material, the students themselves.

<P>  Education research over the past decade has demonstrated traditional methods of instruction presume a single mode of teaching and learning.  Professors lecture, assign homework, give written exams, ensure work is graded, and assign course grades based on a curve.  Students take notes, execute solutions to closed-form problems, study, and take written exams, largely in isolation.  Contrary to these patterns, progressive educators attempt to address the diverse learning modes of their students, rather than demand all students adjust their learning patterns to the professor’s singular mode of instruction.  Open-ended problems and laboratory exercises, group projects, collaborative homework, untimed exams, and course grades based on an absolute scale (as opposed to a curve), constitute some of the techniques currently employed.

<P>  We are attempting to incorporate these insights into a new means for the creation, dissemination, and revision of academic, textual information.  However, by no means have our ideas been conceived <i>ab initio</i>.  Some specific, successful attempts to correct deficiencies in teaching and learning have influenced our thinking, and deserve mention here.

<P>  Mook <A HREF=#Hen94>[Hen94]</A> has undertaken significant reforms in the teaching of introductory physics at Dartmouth College.  A key attribute of his efforts unlocks student frustration in a unique way. Students from previous classes are employed to create problems and solutions, supplementary notes, lab modules, videos, and multimedia displays which address and clarify issues these same students found difficult or confounding.  The impact s are profound.  The student developers are empowered to learn and communicate in new ways, and their efforts result in improved learning and teaching for subsequent classes.

<P>  Mazur <A HREF=#Maz94>[Maz94]</A> has also conceived and implemented introductory physics reforms at Harvard.  He has completely changed his lecture style and format.  His lectures now revolve what he calls ConcepTests.  Each one-hour lecture is broken into four segments.  In each segment, a particular concept receives focus.  Mazur first discusses the concept, in some detail, and occasionally with a brief example.  A relatively simple, multiple choice question is then posed to the class, based on this concept.  Students are first asked to think about the question, and frame their answer.  They are then asked to enter their answers, on either a machine-readable card, or into a digital device which keeps statistics on student responses throughout the lecture, and throughout the course.  Next, students work in pairs to discuss the problem and their individual approaches, and arrive at a common ground.  Finally, the students record their answers, changed or unchanged, once more.  ConcepTests succeed as a teaching and learning tool, and (since statistics are gathered) the success is measurable.  The explosion of sound during the pair discussions is less measurable, but still powerful.  It brings an intimacy previously thought to be impossible for a large, introductory class lecture setting.

<P>  The <i>Primus</i> system from McGraw-Hill was a publishing environment intended to enable greater flexibility in the organization and presentation of textbook information <A HREF=#Pri92>[Pri92]</A>.  Other publishers attempted similar projects.  The central idea was to allow instructors to create their own textbook for a particular course, by selecting chapters from the 'stable' of book titles managed by a specific publisher.  The market has largely rejected these products, for a variety of reasons.  The price/performance ratio for these products was generally to high.  Though the cost to students was in the $25-50 range, the quality of the product -- with disjointed styles and graphical layout, in a loose-bound form -- was insufficient to overcome the lower price.  Instructors felt constrained by the limited number of titles held by a publisher, and by the restriction that whole chapters only from each title chosen must be used.

<P>  Redish <A HREF=#Red93>[Red93]</A>, <A HREF=#Red94>[Red94]</A> has led the University of Maryland's efforts in revolutionizing introductory physics education.  The use of the computer is a principal component of this effort.  The broad-based approach (of looking at a wide-range of systems which physical principles can describe) is similar to that taken at Dartmouth in the context of Engineering Systems (whose case study is described below).  Such an approach can be facilitated and enhanced by the use of the Internet and related tools.

<P>  Digital Library Project funded by NSF <A HREF=#NSF94>[NSF94]</A>.

<P>  Few attempts have yet been made to use the new technological bridges to effect dramatic and constructive change.  Some notable exceptions exist, though even these have shortcomings.  Larson's work <A HREF=#Lar94>[Lar94]</A> discusses the construction of an interactive calculus textbook.  Strict control of content by the authors is implicit, even in this interactive work.  Larson emphasizes correctly that graphic design is frequently a time consuming task.  Shortcuts cannot be made in graphic design, without compromising impact and, ultimately, success.  Proofreading is also a time-consuming task, according to Larson, which has been given little consideration by developers of hypermedia information sources.  The shortcomings in Larson's approach will be addressed in subsequent sections.

<P>  Aminmansour <A HREF=#Ami94>[Ami94]</A> has also made inroads on some of the problems we identify here.  The interactive multimedia book on steel design places great emphasis on graphical interface quality, and on interactivity.  Important provisions are also made to solicit and incorporate feedback from student and faculty users of the database (or 'software', in the language used by this author).

<P>  The <A HREF="http://uu-nna.mit.edu:8001/uu-gna/">Global Network Academy</A> <A HREF=#GNA94>[GNA94]</A>

<P>  Our concept is somewhat similar to Aminmansour's, but goes further.  As in <A HREF=#Lar94>[Lar94]</A> and <A HREF=#Ami94>[Ami94]</A>, we begin with a focused database of textual information.  Our emphasis is on academic subjects, and subjects (such as VLSI Design) which lend themselves to technical training.  Without question, however, our concept may be extended to other arenas, since the database <i>content</i> lies at its core.  And, regardless of the specific content, each database must be dynamic, living, and breathing.

<P>  The database must be flexible enough to include information in any form.  Text, sound, still photos and graphics, animated or moving pictures, may all be incorporated.

<P>  To facilitate our concept, users of the database must have simple means to suggest changes and improvements, and well-satisfied expectations that their suggestions will be incorporated.  Just as in a technical journal, the graphical interface -- the 'look and feel' of the database -- must be well-planned and extremely consistent.  Its specifications must be public, with ample access to translators between many different formats, to allow virtually anyone to author contributions and revisions using their favored composition environment.

<P>  Retrieval of database information must be simple and low-cost.  This necessity is already well-facilitated.  Most academic environments have ubiquitous connections to the Internet.  Many require students to purchase personal computers.  Most other institutions will follow suit in the near future, as the cost of even mid-range computers with the necessary performance drops to attainable levels.

<P>  Authoring and retrieval of information, therefore, are the keys which unlock the door to the center of our concept.  And it is the <i>content</i> of the information database which constitutes the core.  For us, this information lies in the realm of academic science and engineering.  However, our concept is completely general, and can be extended to other realms of information.

<P>  Content is our focus, but it must be supported strongly by other frameworks.  As much as possible, we seek to build on the positive aspects of the Internet and the World Wide Web  At the same time, we must preserve the necessary roles filled today by publishers, textbook authors, production sub-contractors, and others vital to the textbook publication industry.  And, we must add new players to the sphere of activity, to leverage new features and power made possible by evolving technology.  These attributes are discussed more thoroughly in a subsequent section.

<P>  Control over the information in the database is essential to our concept.  However, such control must be exercised carefully, delicately and elegantly.  Too much control, and our concept becomes no better than current textbooks.  Those attractive and powerful features -- interactivity, universal access, and rapid incorporation of new or revised material -- available through the Internet will be lost.  Too little control, however, and the anarchy of such Internet entities as ?? will take hold.

<P>  We intend for a professional editorial review board to have oversight responsibility for each database.  This board will be similar to the review boards of most professional technical journals.  It will, however, have special responsibility for the overall framework of the database.  Furthermore, review board members will have a financial stake in the database, and be contributors to its content.  Rapid turnaround times, between submission of new or revised information, and its incorporation into the database, must be a hallmark of the review board.

<P>  To clarify the path we envision, we have broken down our overall concept into smaller, interrelated frameworks.  These are presented in the next section.

<P><A HREF=#ToC>Return to Table of Contents</A>

<H2><A NAME="frameworks">FRAMEWORKS</A></H2>

 <P>  Our overall concept is depicted in Figure One. At the heart of our concept lies the <i>content</i>.  We conceive of four principal frameworks in support of the content, which are at once linked intimately with the content, and each other.  These are:
	<UL>
	<LI><i>Administration:</i>
	<LI><i>Graphics:</i>
	<LI><i>Intellectual Property Transactions:</i>
	<LI><i>Financial Property Transactions:</i>
	</UL>

<P>  In the following sections, we describe in more detail these individual frameworks.  Following this discussion, we will present an example of the content for one possible database, based on Engineering Systems Analysis and Design.

<A><IMG SRC="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/henning/papers/DAGS95/fig1.gif"></A>

<P><A HREF=#ToC>Return to Table of Contents</A>

<H3><A NAME="administration">Administration</A></H3>

<P>  Figure Two depicts the administrative framework which supports the content-focused information database.  This framework has several specific functions, which are listed below.  Note that there is no requirement for all of these administrative functions to reside under a single corporate umbrella.  In this age of 're-engineering' the American corporation, and spinning the responsibility for individual functions off to independent companies, each of the administrative functions we conceive may well be carried out by a separate company.
	<UL>
	<LI><i>Marketing, Sales, and Distribution:</i>  For any particular database to be truly successful, it must produce revenues which exceed costs.  This assumption implies the need for these functions.  In and of themselves, they do not differ from their counterparts in traditional publishing.  However, to promote our concept, these functions must incorporate the new technology based on the Internet in order to advertise, sell, and distribute a particular database in softcopy form.  Since the database, or major portions of it, will also be realized in compact disk (hardcopy) form, traditional routes of marketing, sales, and distribution must be maintained.
	<LI><i>File, Hardware, and Network Services:</i>  The database must be maintained in appropriate ways.  Its integrity must be preserved and ensured.  Appropriate access for authors and retrievers must be authorized.
	<LI><i>Physical Production:</i>  Hard copies of the database, or portions of it, in paper or compact disk form, must be administered.
	<LI><i>Acquisitions:</i>  New authors for existing databases must be sought out, and encouraged to make contributions.  Authors for new databases must also be sought out.  Market surveys and analyses, to determine which new databases are economically viable and should be pursued, must be made.
	<LI><i>Legal Services:</i>  This area includes torts related to all aspects of the database, except for those agreements concerning intellectual property.
	<LI><i>Accounting:</i>  As a matter of course, accounting will be a necessary function for all the frameworks supporting the database.
	</UL>

<P><A HREF=#ToC>Return to Table of Contents</A>

<H3><A NAME="graphic">Graphic Design</A></H3>

<P>  Figure Three depicts the graphics framework for the database.  We are presuming that the dominate interaction will be visual (by sight) and mechanical (by a mouse or keyboard).  However, there is no reason for other means of interaction (e.g. sound) to be excluded.  For our purposes here, we refer to the process of presenting the database content as 'graphic design', though perhaps 'interface design' would be a more general and enduring term.

<P>  This framework fulfills the following functions:
	<UL>
	<LI><i>Database Format Specifications:</i>  These specifications refer to the 'look and feel' of the database, as perceived by browsers.  It is important for these specifications to be widely available and understood, so that the broadest spectrum of potential and actual authors may be encouraged to submit material for use in the database.
	<LI><i>Format Translators and Convertors:</i>  The database must not constrain authors to use a particular, limited and limiting set of authoring tools.  Nor may the database be constrained to be viewed by only a few browsing tools.  Just as graphics conversion software, such as gifConverter <A HREF=#Mit94>[Mit94]</A>, allows files of many formats to be read in, and output files of many forms to be generated, so too must the database accept input from a variety of formats, and support browsing using a wide variety of tools.  It is likely that the database will exist in a single format (e.g. SGML or HTML), common to most browsing tools.
	<LI><i>Authoring and Production Environment:</i>  While no single authoring environment can or should become an inflexible standard for all database authors, it is still reasonable for the database to recommend the authoring or multimedia production environment which would streamline the process of bringing new information into the database.  As new authoring and production tools become available (e.g. ScriptX <A HREF=#Kal94>[Kal94]</A>, they will be assessed for use in the authoring environment.
	<LI><i>Browsing and Playback Environment:</i>  Some consideration will also be made for making the database compatible with currently available and popular browsing and playback tools.  Activity here will center on ensuring the database format can be accessed and presented easily by these tools.
	<LI><i>Synthesis with New Tools:</i>  The Internet and related technologies are, today, in a state of great flux.  The database must, therefore guard against being left behind by the information marketplace, by continual evaluation of new tools, beyond those used in authoring and retrieving information.
	<LI><i>Search Engines and Other Tools:</i>  Texis <A HREF=#Mne94>[Mne94]</A>
	</UL>

<H3><A NAME="transactions">Transactions</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="submissions"><i>Intellectual Property</i></A></H4>

<P>  Intellectual property is created by authors, and constitutes the database content.  Customers access this property in a variety of ways.  Since the core of the database is its content, this framework is arguably the most important.  The framework for these activities is shown in Figure Four.

	<UL>
	<LI><i>Content Organization Specification:</i>  Within this framework, the organization of the database content must be specified, much the way a textbook is organized according to a Table of Contents, List of Figures, List of Tables, and Index.  Here, though, the organization into regular entities will not be as simple as creating textbook 'chapters', with perhaps homework problems and other references listed at the end of each chapter.
	<LI><i>Review of Submitted Material:</i>  Creation.  Submission.  Referee.  Incorporation.  Handling obsolescence.
	<LI><i>Update Database:</i>  remove or retire or annihilate.  generate, create.

<H4><A NAME="finances"><i>Finances</i></A></H4>

<P>  Once the intellectual property is created and made accessible, it must be exchanged for some other property, typically financial. Figure Five depicts the support framework for these exchange activities.

<A><IMG SRC="http://hypatia.dartmouth.edu/henning/papers/DAGS95/fig5.gif"></A>

<P>  Initially, in developing our concept, we considered whether each database should be so self-regulating, that its cost would be free to the individual user.  Several facts seemed to make this feasible and attractive.  (More on Aquarian version, Internet tradition of Newsgroups,

<P>  In the end, however, it became clear that each database, to be truly successful, must be operated on a for-profit basis.  This conclusion was driven primarily by the realization we had chosen an intermediate level of editorial oversight, between the constricting control exercised by authors of present-day textbooks, and the virtual absence of control exercised over its content by an Internet topical newsgroup.  Having chosen a middle path ( with intellectual rigidity and high profits on the one hand, and intellectual chaos and no profits on the other), we developed the intention that each database exist on a for-profit basis.

<P>  Having made this decision, several options present themselves.  Charges could be made on a per-transaction basis.  In this scenario, a record of each piece of information accessed by the user would have to be kept, with appropriate charges made for this access, and billings sent on a periodic basis.  In some sense, such an accounting scheme would build on, or be parallel to, efforts to implement interactive learning <A HREF=#Eri95>[Eri95]</A>.  We believe this choice to be too cumbersome for the maintainers of the database, and too confusing for consumers.

<P>  We prefer instead the subscriber model.  Users will pay a fixed fee to purchase a compact disk containing the most current  version of the database.  Our preliminary studies indicate the consumer cost for this CD will be approximately $25.  Also get access to server for limited period of time.  Time extensions and/or CD upgrades may be purchased for small, periodic fee (e.g. $5/year).  Difficulties if database is distributed as CD, with additional access to fully updated server.  (feedback that people want something tangible these days.)

<P>  Stock model.  Capitalization.  Who controls the database?  Dilution?  Time dependence of shares:  who decides when you must sell?

<P><A HREF=#ToC>Return to Table of Contents</A>

<H2><A NAME="uniqueness">UNIQUENESS</A></H2>

<P>  How unique is this project?

<P>  {Addressing problems with Larson's approach.  [Distributed authorship.  Distributed review, proofreading.  Resulting work is assumed to be immutable.  Consumers interact with the immutable product, but do not have the opportunity to influence its improvement or change.]}

<P><A HREF=#ToC>Return to Table of Contents</A>

<H3><A NAME="attributes">Attributes</A></H3>

<P>  Distributed authorship.  Setting design standards, similar to look and feel associated with most journals these days, allows content creators/authors to create content to these standards, thus minimizing costs of publication.  Promotes active learning.  Offers incentives for activity, disincentives to passivity.  Replication/extensive of concept to other databases.  Engages students/trainees; empowers.

<P>  Other ramifications:  Following the pattern of 're-engineering' of the American corporation, in whose midst we live today, we expect our concept will promote the growth of a large number of small companies, each addressing one of the frameworks we have outlined above, or even one part of one of these frameworks.  For instance, present-day publishers of traditional textbooks have, in-house, staff to handle acquisition of new material, marketing, accounting, and production.  Even so, many activities are sub-contracted

<P><A HREF=#ToC>Return to Table of Contents</A>

<H3><A NAME="challenges">Challenges</A></H3>

<P>  A number of challenges must be surmounted before our path can be deemed a success.  Most obviously, success will be measured by market acceptance.  These challenges are discussed separately in the following paragraphs.

<P>  <i>Distributed Learning</i>
<P>

<P>  <i>Bundling Tools</i>
<P>  Matlab, Mathematica, Maple.

<P>  The choice of a search engine for the database is important.  We have settled on the use of Texis <A HREF=#Mne94>[Mne94]</A>

<P>  <i>Copyright</i>
<P>  John Erickson thesis.  AT&T ftp papers.

<P>  <i>Building Coalitions of Authors and Users</i>
<P>  It is critical that the need for the database be agreed upon by parties from a number of institutions, academic or otherwise.  Whether it is the common nature of the institutions which drives the collaboration, or their common interest, is somewhat immaterial.  In either case, a database conceived or formed by a single person or institution will be likely to fail the test of economic success, which is to be profitable.

<P>  Toward this end, we have established collaborative relationships with Bucknell University.

<P>  <i>Choosing Appropriate Databases</i>
<P>  To achieve critical mass, get over the initial activation energy, and propel this concept forward, databases with large audiences should be sought first.  Introductory calculus, introductory physics, introductory chemistry, and engineering systems appear to be ideal candidates.

<P>  <i>Rate of Information Creation and Annihilation (Turnover)</i>
<P>  Relation to following case study (slow turnover, low bandwidth after initial creation, unless marketplace 'hit')(other high-rate databases, e.g. micro-machines, other topics on leading edge of research and transfer to marketplace).

<P>  <i>Competitive Databases</i>
<P>  If our concept proves successful, we expect competitive databases to arise.  Since one of our motivations is to lower the cost of instruction materials for the consumer, this eventuality can only improve the cost and performance of each database product.  The electronic 'publisher', or consortium responsible for each database, will need to take competitive positions similar to those employed by present-day textbook publishers.  For instance, nearly every academic textbook publisher in the sciences carries one or more introductory calculus titles on their list.  We expect no different a result with our concept.

<H2><A NAME="case-study">CASE STUDY:  Engineering Systems</A></H2>

<P>  We present here a brief example derived from the engineering curriculum at Dartmouth College.

<H2><A NAME="conclusion">CONCLUSIONS</A></H2>

<P>  We have presented our concept for the authoring and retrieval of textual information which, in the past and even present, would be presented as a bound textbook.  Given the power of present and future technology, however, the restrictions of this format have truly become antiquated and obsolete.  We envision replacing the traditional means of authoring and publishing, by a new set of frameworks.  These frameworks will create dynamic, living databases of information, textual in nature, which address the needs and sophisticated expectations of a large, computer-literate audience.

<P>  We have begun the process of developing one such database, using the body of knowledge termed Engineering Systems Analysis and Design as our point of departure from tradition.  We have discussed the advantages and disadvantages of our concepts, as well as our ideas for enhancing the former, and overcoming the latter.
