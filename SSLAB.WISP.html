<title> WISP microlithography </title>
<h1> 1994 <b>WISP</b> Projects:  MICROLITHOGRAPHY </h1>
<p>
In making very small devices (be they electronic or mechanical), we need to transfer the patterns which we design on a computer onto the material of the device. This is done using microlithography.  The features are first transferred to a "resist" film on the surface of the wafer, then the resist is developed and finally the features are etched into the material.  The resist film is like a very high contrast black and white photographic film: there is no gray scale-- the features are either there or not there.  These WISP projects deal with how we get the smallest possible images in the resist.  
<p>
The two projects correspond to two methods we use to write the pattern onto the resist:  ultraviolet light (UV photolithography) and an electron beam (e-beam lithography).    In using light to expose the photoresist, the minimum feature size is determined by the wavelength of the light.  Ultraviolet light is used because it has a smaller wavelength than visible light.  In our lab, the smallest features we can hope to obtain with UV light are about 0.7 microns.  On the other hand, the "wavelength" of the 20 keV electrons used in e-beam lithography is much smaller than any features we will ever write.  The limitation of e-beam lithography has more to do with the way the electrons scatter in the material.  The minimum size we might hope to get in this project is  about 0.1 micron.   In neither UV photolithography nor e-beam lithography have we made a serious attempt to get down to these smallest features.  These projects represent your  chance to contribute to research in microfabrication, as well as to write your name smaller than anyone at Dartmouth ever has!

This work involves optimization of several steps:
<ul>
<li>Spinning on the resist (what thickness is optimum?)
<li>Baking the resist to harden it (how long and at what temperature?)
<li>Exposing the sample (what dose should be used so not to over or under expose?)
<li>Developing the sample (what solvent to use and how long to develop it?)
<li>Baking the resist to drive off any remaining developer solvent and harden it.
<li>Sputtering or evaporating a metal film on to allow examination in the SEM.
</ul>
The end result will be evaluated through scanning electron microscope (SEM) photos.
