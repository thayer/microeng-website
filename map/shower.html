<h1>Eyewash and Shower</h1>
<IMG SRC="showereyewash1.JPG" width="200" ALIGN=RIGHT
If you are exposed to chemicals, as you move to the shower/eyewash
describe the situation to your lab partner.
e.g. "I've splashed hydrochloric acid in my eyes.  I'm not wearing contacts".<p>
Start flushing with water immediately.

<h2> EMERGENCY SHOWER (next to acid cabinet)</h2>
<h3> For use if your skin has been exposed to dangerous chemicals such as acids</h3>
<ul>
<li> Pull triangle on chain to operate shower.
<li> Remove contaminated clothing as you flush yourself.  Don't be modest; you can dress in a clean tyvek suit on the way out.
<li> Do not concern yourself with water on the floor.
<li> Wash for 15 minutes (that seems like a very long time; have your
lab partner time it).
</ul>

<h2> EMERGENCY EYEWASH (next to acid cabinet)</h2>
<h3> For use if your eyes have been exposed to dangerous chemicals such as acids</h3>
<ul>
<li> Push lever to operate eyewash.
<li> Hold eye lids open and direct flow into eyes.
<li> Remove contact lenses while flushing eyes (lab partner: ask about contacts, don't assume)
<li> Do not concern yourself with water on the floor.
<li> Wash for 15 minutes (that seems like a very long time; have your
lab partner time it).
</ul>

There is a drain under the eyewash and shower; lab partner can pull the
lid to drain some of the excess water if desired.
