Fume hood for acid etching.
<p>
This hood is equiped with a Nyont <a href="../equipment/Nyont.pdf">alarm</a> on the right side. The alarm indicates inadequate reduced pressure in the exhaust line
to provide fume hood protection.   If it sounds, lower the sash all the way, leave the room, and notify authorities.
