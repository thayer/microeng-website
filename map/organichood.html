Fume hood for use with organics 
(acetone, methanol, isopropanol, TCA, photoresist stripping, ...)
<p>
This hood is equiped with a Nyont <a href="../equipment/Nyont.pdf">alarm</a> on the left side. The alarm indicates inadequate 
reduced pressure in the exhaust line
to provide fume hood protection.   If it sounds, lower the sash all the way, leave the room, 
and notify authorities.
